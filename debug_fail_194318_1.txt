        "implication_supplier": "Supplier's liability is limited to the explicitly agreed-upon express warranties, reducing exposure to claims based on implied warranties that can be vague or broad in scope. This is a favorable position for the supplier, but they must ensure their express warranties are clear and manageable for them to uphold. They might face resistance from the Company if the Company wants broader protection for certain products/services or in certain jurisdictions where implied warranties are strong consumer protections that cannot be easily disclaimed. However, the Company is willing to accept this approach, so it is a good position for the supplier to take in negotiations with the Company.
