If not agreed, the Supplier retains ownership by default, which is a strong negotiating position for them if the Company fails to address it proactively in the contract. This may also affect their pricing model for the services provided to the Company, as they may need to factor in the loss of IPR ownership for the specific work results delivered to the Company. However, it also provides clarity on what they own and what they don't, which is beneficial for their own IP management and commercialization strategy for their own products and services. If they retain ownership, they can reuse the work for other clients, which is a commercial advantage for them. If they transfer ownership, they lose this advantage for the specific work results, but they may be able to negotiate a higher price for the services.
