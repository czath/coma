Where a party wishes to transfer both the benefit and burden of the contract without any residual liability (as is usually the case), the assignment of the contract would generally needs to be done by way of a novation. For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment. This in itself is not issue in the majority of cases, as most jurisdictions will recognize the term novation to mean the same as transfer of a contract.",
        "plain_text": "Under UK law, an assignment of rights typically transfers only contract benefits. To transfer both benefits and burdens without residual liability, a novation is generally required. For UK-governed agreements, it is useful to specifically mention both assignment and novation, potentially requiring a separate novation agreement. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term 'novation' is often incorrectly used in other jurisdictions for contract transfer or assignment. However, this is usually not an issue as most jurisdictions will recognize 'novation' to mean the same as a transfer of a contract.",
        "expert_insight": "This provides crucial legal context for contracts governed by UK law, differentiating assignment (benefits only) from novation (benefits and burdens with full release) and highlighting the need for novation for a complete transfer of obligations. It also clarifies that while 'novation' is often technically misapplied in non-UK jurisdictions, its intent as a full contract transfer is generally understood, minimizing issues in most cases. Understanding these nuances is critical for effective and legally sound contract transfers, especially in international contexts.",
