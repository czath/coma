You should therefore expect in particular US based vendors to replace ‘best efforts’ with less onerous efforts standards such as in e.g. ‘commercial reasonable efforts’.",

        "expert_insight": "This highlights a cautious approach by US vendors, suggesting they want to avoid the most extreme interpretation of 'best efforts' and mitigate potential liabilities.

The 'therefore' indicates a justification for this expectation. Therefore, 'OTHER' is the most fitting type. Among the 'OTHER' subtypes, 'TACTIC' best describes the vendor's negotiation strategy that the company is instructed to anticipate.\nValue Assessment: Candidate 3's 'verbatim_text' was chosen as it includes the preceding sentence that provides the crucial context and justification for *why* US vendors are expected to behave this way, making the finding self-sufficient and clearer. The 'plain_text' is clear and concise. The finding provides valuable strategic insight for negotiation.\nType-Specific Criteria: As a 'TACTIC', it clearly describes a predictable behavior and its underlying reason, which is highly actionable for preparing negotiation strategy.\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific, helps in negotiation by anticipating vendor moves, clarifies the rationale behind such moves, and protects the company by enabling informed responses.

This constitutes a direct instruction. While the subject matter is critical, the instruction 'be careful' falls under the category of generic advice, which, according to the rules, should be classified as 'OTHER' with a 'subtype: INSTRUCTION' and 'NEVER GUIDELINE'. The high importance of the subject, however, elevates its utility. \nValue Assessment: The finding is clear, self-sufficient, and provides crucial context for the instruction.

The odds are that the supplier has no issues in committing itself to the majority of the requirements but only has reservations on some of the requirements.
