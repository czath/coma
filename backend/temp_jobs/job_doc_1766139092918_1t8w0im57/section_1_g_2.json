'Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests.' (Candidates 1, 4, 6) - All agents classified this as a GUIDELINE (HIGH).\n2.  'The completion of acceptance should be subject to the successful completion of acceptance tests that are performed by either Zebracorp or our end customers, or, as applicable, both jointly.' (Candidates 2, 3, 5, 7) - Agents were split between GUIDELINE (3 agents) and OTHER (1 agent). \n\nTYPE RESOLUTION: For the second finding, the phrase 'should be subject to' within a section explicitly titled 'Zebracorp Preferred Position' indicates a desired contractual obligation or rule. Therefore, classifying it as a `GUIDELINE` is appropriate, as it defines a specific condition for acceptance that Zebracorp aims to implement in its contracts. The classification of `CRITICAL` is supported by its inclusion in the 'Preferred Position' section and its fundamental nature in controlling the acceptance process.\n\nSELECTION JUSTIFICATION: Given the instruction to produce a *single* Golden Record, and the presence of two distinct rules within the cluster, a choice must be made. The second finding, which states Zebracorp's preferred position on *how* acceptance is determined (i.e., subject to tests performed by Zebracorp or its customers), is a more foundational and strategic guideline. It dictates a core control mechanism for Zebracorp's quality assurance and risk mitigation. The first finding, while important, describes a typical procedural outcome (issuing a certificate) *after* acceptance criteria are met, making it a secondary detail compared to the conditions for acceptance itself. Therefore, the second finding is selected as the primary Golden Record for this cluster due to its strategic importance and explicit mention as a 'Zebracorp Preferred Position'.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT & UTILITY CHECK: The selected finding is clear, self-sufficient, and actionable. It creates a specific condition for acceptance, directly impacting contractual terms and protecting Zebracorp's interests by ensuring control over the verification process. It helps a human negotiate better by highlighting a critical non-negotiable or highly preferred stance.",
