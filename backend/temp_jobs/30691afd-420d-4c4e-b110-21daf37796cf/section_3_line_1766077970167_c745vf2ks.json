        "verbatim_text": "Please note that this document is company confidential and for Zebracorp internal use only. This document must not be distributed outside Zebracorp.",
        "plain_text": "This document is company confidential and for Zebracorp internal use only; it must not be distributed outside Zebracorp.",
        "expert_insight": "This is a critical internal guideline establishing the confidential nature of the document and strictly prohibiting its external distribution. It safeguards Zebracorp's proprietary information, prevents unauthorized disclosure, and mitigates risks of competitive disadvantage, legal repercussions, and reputational damage. Adherence is mandatory for all internal personnel.",
        "confidence": 1.0,
        "classification": "CRITICAL",
        "conditions": "Applies to 'this document', which is explicitly identified as company confidential and for Zebracorp internal use only.",
        "justification": "The document's classification as 'company confidential' and 'for Zebracorp internal use only' serves as the direct justification for the strict prohibition on external distribution, ensuring the protection of sensitive company information.",
        "implication_company": "Zebracorp ensures the protection of its confidential and proprietary information, intellectual property, and competitive advantage. Non-compliance by employees exposes the company to significant legal, financial, and reputational risks, including potential data breaches and loss of trade secrets.",
        "implication_supplier": "This is primarily an internal Zebracorp directive. It does not directly impose obligations on suppliers. However, if a supplier were to gain unauthorized access to this document, it would indicate a breach of Zebracorp's internal security protocols, and any existing confidentiality agreements with the supplier would apply.",
        "source_insight": "The introductory sentences explicitly state the document's confidential status, its intended internal use, and a clear, mandatory prohibition ('must not') against external distribution."
      },
      "rationale": "Consensus Check: The cluster shows a split in 'type' classification, with some agents identifying it as 'GUIDELINE' (1, 4, 5) and others as 'OTHER' (2, 3). Agent 3 extracts only the descriptive part as 'OTHER (INFO)', while Agent 2 extracts the full text as 'OTHER (INSTRUCTION)'. Agents 1, 4, and 5 correctly identify the core prohibition as a 'GUIDELINE'.\n\nTie-Breaker & Value Assessment: The source text contains both a descriptive statement ('this document is company confidential and for Zebracorp internal use only') and a direct, mandatory prohibition ('This document must not be distributed outside Zebracorp.'). The descriptive part provides the essential context and justification for the prohibition. To ensure clarity and self-sufficiency, the Golden Record must combine both sentences. The phrase 'must not be distributed' clearly establishes a specific, actionable obligation/restriction, making 'GUIDELINE' the most appropriate classification for the combined text, rather than 'OTHER (INSTRUCTION)' or 'OTHER (INFO)'. The 'Please note that' introductory phrase is conversational and can be omitted from the 'plain_text' while retaining the core information.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The consolidated text creates a clear, specific, and mandatory restriction on document distribution. It is not generic advice and directly impacts information security and compliance, thus fitting the 'GUIDELINE' type perfectly. The 'CRITICAL' classification is consistently supported across agents for the prohibition.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, actionable, and critical for protecting Zebracorp's confidential information. It helps enforce internal security policies and mitigate significant legal, financial, and reputational risks. Therefore, it passes the utility check.\n\nDecision: The finding is valid. The Golden Record consolidates the full context and the mandatory rule into a single 'CRITICAL GUIDELINE'.",
