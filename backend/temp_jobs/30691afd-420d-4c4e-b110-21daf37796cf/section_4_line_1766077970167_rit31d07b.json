      "rationale": "Consensus Check: Agents were split on the type, with one classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' and three as 'OTHER' (INFO). Value Assessment: The verbatim text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides critical context regarding the document's legal standing. Type-Specific Criteria: While phrased as a descriptive statement, this text functions as a fundamental disclaimer that dictates how the document's information *must not* be used (i.e., not as conclusive legal advice or a substitute for individual legal counsel). This imposes an implicit, yet critical, obligation or restriction on the recipient, thereby limiting the author's liability. This active limitation on use and reliance qualifies it as a 'GUIDELINE' rather than mere 'INFO'. It is a specific rule for engagement with the document. Utility Check: This is a highly specific and critical clause that protects the company from liability and clarifies the legal weight of the document, making it essential for any user. Therefore, it is classified as a Critical Guideline.",
