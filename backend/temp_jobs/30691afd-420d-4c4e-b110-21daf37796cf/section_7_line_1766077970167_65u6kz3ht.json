      "rationale": "Consensus Check: Agents were split on type, with one classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' and three as 'OTHER' (Instruction). Tie-Breaker Decision: The phrase 'Please send' indicates an invitation or request, not a mandatory obligation. Therefore, it does not create a specific right, obligation, or restriction typical of a 'GUIDELINE'. It is best classified as an 'OTHER' type, specifically an 'INSTRUCTION'. Value Assessment: The text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides actionable information (where to send feedback). It passes the clarity and context test. Type-Specific Criteria: As an 'INSTRUCTION', it clearly directs the reader on a procedural step. It is not a definition. Utility Check: This item is specific and helps a human understand how to provide input, contributing to document improvement. It is not filler. Therefore, the finding is valid and classified as an Instruction.",
