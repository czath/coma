      "rationale": "Consensus Check: The cluster presented two distinct ideas. The first, identified by Agents 2 and 4, stated that 'best efforts' clauses are a 'source of confusion' (classified as OTHER/INFO). The second, identified by Agents 1, 3, and 5, focused on 'best efforts' being 'vague and not providing a firm commitment'. For this second idea, Agents 1 and 5 classified it as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 3 classified it as OTHER. \n\nTie-Breaker & Value Assessment: The source text explicitly states, 'In all cases it is important to keep in mind that the phrase ‘best efforts’ together with all its variants are ultimately very vague and do not provide a firm commitment to meet the agreed requirement or obligation. Hence, we should, despite their prevalence, be careful in accepting such phrases.' The phrase 'Hence, we should... be careful' clearly indicates a direct instruction or obligation, making it a GUIDELINE. Candidate 5 captures this complete instruction most accurately. The 'source of confusion' (from Agents 2 and 4) is a descriptive characteristic that contributes to the vagueness, but the core actionable advice for the user is the caution against accepting such vague commitments. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is the most critical and actionable finding for this cluster.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The selected finding is a clear GUIDELINE as it provides specific advice ('be careful in accepting such phrases') that creates an obligation for the company during negotiations. It is not generic advice. The `verbatim_text` is complete and self-sufficient. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified because the finding highlights a fundamental risk (lack of firm commitment) that directly impacts enforceability and accountability.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific to 'best efforts' clauses, directly aids in better contract negotiation by warning against a common pitfall, clarifies the inherent weakness of these terms, and protects the company from vague commitments. It passes the utility check.\n\nConsolidation: The Golden Record is built upon Candidate 5, incorporating enhanced expert insights and implications from Candidates 1 and 5 to provide a comprehensive and robust finding. Other candidates were either less complete, misclassified, or represented a less critical, descriptive aspect of the overall issue.",
