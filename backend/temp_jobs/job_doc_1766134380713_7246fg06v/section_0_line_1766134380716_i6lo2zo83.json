        "justification": "Acceptance provisions are essential since they ultimately define whether the works rendered by the subcontractor meet the mutually agreed requirements, and when these works have been completed enabling the supplier/subcontractor to recognize revenue. Acceptance generally triggers the right for the subcontractor to invoice and get paid for its deliverables and it can stop the liquidated damages clock. Moreover, the majority of contracts stipulate that the warranty starts to run from the date of acceptance.",

      "rationale": "Consensus Check: Agents 1, 3, 4, 5 classified this as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 2 classified it as 'OTHER' (INSTRUCTION). \nTie-Breaker: The phrase 'should always be drafted and reviewed with special care' is an instruction or advice on *how* to perform a task (drafting/reviewing contracts), rather than a specific contractual obligation, right, or restriction that would be found *within* a contract. It is generic advice for contract drafters, albeit critical. Therefore, 'OTHER' with subtype 'INSTRUCTION' is the most appropriate classification.\nValue Assessment: The wording is clear and self-sufficient. The source text immediately provides the justification for this instruction, which is captured in the 'justification' field.\nType-Specific Criteria: As an 'OTHER' (INSTRUCTION), it provides valuable guidance for Zebracorp's internal contract management process. It is not a 'GUIDELINE' because it does not create a specific right, obligation, or restriction for the parties to the contract, but rather advises on the process of creating such provisions.\nUtility Check: This is a highly valuable instruction, emphasizing the critical importance of acceptance provisions due to their wide-ranging impact on payments, warranties, and dispute resolution. It helps a human negotiator understand the foundational importance of these clauses.\nDecision: Valid, classified as OTHER (INSTRUCTION) with HIGH priority.",
