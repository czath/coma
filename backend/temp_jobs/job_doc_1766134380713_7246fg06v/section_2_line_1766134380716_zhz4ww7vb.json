My assessment is that it is a clear, actionable directive for contract negotiation, making 'GUIDELINE' the correct classification. Candidate 2 refers to a specific example clause that implements this guideline; however, to create a single Golden Record representing the overarching policy, the directive itself is prioritized.\nValue Assessment: The chosen verbatim text is clear and self-sufficient. The 'plain_text' has been enhanced to incorporate the context of 'for these reasons' from the preceding source text, ensuring it stands alone without dangling references.\nType-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it is highly actionable, creating a specific obligation for Zebracorp's legal team to secure certain assignment rights. It is complete and classified as 'CRITICAL' due to its strategic importance for corporate reorganizations, M&A, and divestitures.\nUtility Check: This finding is specific, directly aids negotiation strategy, and protects Zebracorp's long-term strategic flexibility, making it highly valuable.",
