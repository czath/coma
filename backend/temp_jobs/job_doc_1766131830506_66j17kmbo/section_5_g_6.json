      "rationale": "Consensus: Both agents correctly identified the text as 'OTHER' with 'INFO' subtype, indicating it's a heading or topic identifier. Evaluation: The verbatim text 'COMPONENT/MATERIALS LIABILITY' clearly functions as a heading, introducing a specific legal area. It passes the Value Assessment as it is self-sufficient and clearly defines a topic. It passes the Type-Specific Criteria for 'OTHER' by providing essential contextualization for a significant section of a legal document. It passes the Utility Check as it helps in understanding the document's structure and the critical areas it addresses. The consolidated record combines the best insights from both agents.",
