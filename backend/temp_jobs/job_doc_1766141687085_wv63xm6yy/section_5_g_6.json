Evaluation: The selected verbatim text, 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs and to be able to fully meet the occasional order cancellation and to meet our forecasted demand (as well as some additional drop-in orders as set forth in the flexibility parameters).', clearly establishes a specific obligation and expectation for vendors.

The classification as 'HIGH' priority is appropriate given its foundational nature in defining liability. While other candidates in the cluster provided valuable context or justification, this specific guideline is the most direct and actionable policy statement regarding component/materials liability, making it the most suitable 'Golden Record' when consolidating to a single object.",
