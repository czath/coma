In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts.

The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company."
