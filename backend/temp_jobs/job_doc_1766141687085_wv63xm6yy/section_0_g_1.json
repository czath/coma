Consolidation Decision: Due to the strict requirement for 'verbatim_text' to be exact and represent a single, contiguous segment, these two distinct sentences cannot be combined into a single 'decision_content' object. I have selected the finding related to 'explanations on the implications of certain key legal terms' as the primary Golden Record because understanding implications is more directly aligned with the playbook's stated purpose of providing 'guidance on negotiating procurement contracts'.
