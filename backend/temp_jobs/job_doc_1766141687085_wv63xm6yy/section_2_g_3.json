      "rationale": "Consensus Check: All agents correctly identified the type as 'OTHER'. Agents 4 and 5 classified the subtype as 'INSTRUCTION', which is more accurate than Agent 2's 'INFO' given the explicit directive 'Please refer to'. Value Assessment: The text is a clear, self-sufficient instruction for document navigation. It passes the 'So What?' test by providing essential guidance on where to find critical information. Type-Specific Criteria: As an 'OTHER' type with 'INSTRUCTION' subtype, it clearly directs the reader. Utility Check: This finding is specific, helps users navigate the document efficiently, and clarifies where to find arbitration details, thus protecting both parties by ensuring they know where to look for dispute resolution terms. Therefore, it is a valid and useful finding.",
