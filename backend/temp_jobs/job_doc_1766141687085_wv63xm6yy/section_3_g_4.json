Also note that our right to assign the contract should not be made subject to us remaining jointly liable for the assigned contract together with the assignee. The assignment should be unconditional in the sense that Zebracorp will not accept liability for any commitments made by any third party assignee.

Consolidation: The cluster contained two distinct, but closely related, critical guidelines regarding Zebracorp's preferred assignment clause position: (1) maximum flexibility to assign without supplier consent to affiliates/successor entities, and (2) ensuring a clean exit with no joint liability post-assignment. These were consolidated into a single comprehensive 'GUIDELINE' to represent the cluster's overall finding as a unified Golden Record, as per the instruction to return a single JSON object.",

For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement.

In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale.

In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not ‘assigned’ to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.
