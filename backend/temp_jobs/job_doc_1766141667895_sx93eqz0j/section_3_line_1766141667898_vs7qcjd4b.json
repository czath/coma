The second, 'In all cases it is important to keep in mind that the phrase ‘best efforts’ together with all its variants are ultimately very vague and do not provide a firm commitment to meet the agreed requirement or obligation,' had a split consensus: Agents 1, 4, and 5 classified it as 'GUIDELINE' (CRITICAL), while Agent 2 classified it as 'OTHER' (INFO). \n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT & TYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The 'source of confusion' statement is descriptive and provides useful background information, making it a valid 'OTHER' (INFO) finding. However, the 'vagueness and no firm commitment' statement is a fundamental legal principle that directly informs how one *must* approach and evaluate such clauses in a contract. It is a critical warning that dictates a specific mindset and strategy during negotiation, thus functioning as a clear 'GUIDELINE'. It is self-sufficient and highly actionable, providing a core directive for risk management. Given the instruction to consolidate into a *single* golden record, the 'GUIDELINE' regarding the inherent weakness of 'best efforts' clauses is significantly more impactful and critical for a legal analysis system than the 'OTHER' (INFO) statement about confusion. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is prioritized.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: The selected guideline is highly specific, helps a human negotiate better by understanding the inherent legal weakness of 'best efforts' clauses, and directly protects the company by warning against false security. It is a critical piece of information for contract review and negotiation strategy.",
