It explicitly directs the reader to another section for details on arbitration. Utility Check: This instruction is highly useful as it guides users to the complete arbitration terms, preventing misinterpretation of a potentially incomplete or absent clause at this specific point. It helps a human understand where to find critical information for negotiation or dispute resolution. Therefore, it is classified as a valid and critical instruction.",
