      "rationale": "CONSENSUS CHECK: Candidates 1, 3, 5, and 6 refer to the same verbatim text. Agents 1, 4, and 5 classified it as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 2 classified it as 'OTHER' (INSTRUCTION). The Supreme Judge acts as tie-breaker and classifies it as 'GUIDELINE' due to its nature as a specific, actionable directive for contract negotiation. Candidates 2 and 7 refer to a different verbatim text and were consistently classified as 'GUIDELINE'. Candidate 4 refers to a third verbatim text and was classified as 'OTHER' (INFO). \n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: All candidates passed the clarity and self-sufficiency test. The 'plain_text' for each candidate successfully contextualized any 'dangling references' from the verbatim text.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The primary finding (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 6) is an actionable directive for Zebracorp's contract negotiation, making 'GUIDELINE' appropriate. It is complete and specific. The secondary finding (Candidates 2, 7) is also an actionable guideline, representing a specific clause Zebracorp seeks. The third finding (Candidate 4) is a valid 'OTHER' (INFO) providing justification for a related guideline.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: All findings are useful. The primary finding provides a critical negotiation objective. The secondary finding provides a specific contractual mechanism. The third finding provides essential context for negotiation strategy.\n\nCONSOLIDATION DECISION: The prompt requires a SINGLE JSON object for the cluster. This cluster contains one overarching guideline (Zebracorp's objective for maximum assignment flexibility to affiliates/successors), one specific example clause that embodies this guideline, and one justification for a related guideline (assignment by operation of law). The most fundamental and overarching finding for this cluster, which focuses on 'ASSIGNMENT' and 'maximum flexibility', is the directive to ensure this flexibility. Therefore, the Golden Record is consolidated from Candidates 1, 3, 5, and 6, representing this core guideline. The other candidates, while valid findings in isolation, are considered either specific examples or supporting rationale for related but distinct guidelines, and thus are not included as separate Golden Records within this single output constraint.",

For example, if Zebracorp was planning on forming a merger with another company, we would work from the assumption that our contracts with our suppliers/subcontractors would be automatically transferred to the new merged entity by operation of law without the need seek consents from our supplier base. An assignment restriction described above is likely to impact the timing, cost and our ability to consummate a \"smooth\" merger or such other transaction."

However, [Zebracorp] may, without the prior written consent of the [Supplier], unconditionally assign, novate, delegate or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations under this [Agreement], in whole, in part, or through a splitting of the [Agreement], to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line to which this contract relates. As of the effective date of the assignment, novation, delegation, or transfer, the assignee entity(ies) assumes all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the [Agreement], and [Zebracorp] is unconditionally released and discharged from all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the [Agreement]. [Supplier] will work cooperatively with [Zebracorp] and the assignee entity(ies) to ensure a smooth and orderly transition.”"
