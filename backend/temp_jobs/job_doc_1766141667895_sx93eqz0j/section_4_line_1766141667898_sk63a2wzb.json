Vendors are also expected to fully meet occasional order cancellations and Zebracorp's forecasted demand, including additional drop-in orders as set forth in flexibility parameters.",
        "expert_insight": "This establishes Zebracorp's default position: suppliers bear the risk of unconsumed materials due to cancellations or forecast inaccuracies.

        "justification": "This is explicitly stated as a 'general rule' and defines a core expectation for vendors, shifting significant financial risk away from Zebracorp. The risk that forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party’s business risk, especially for multi-customer vendors, making it a standard business risk for the supplier.",

      "rationale": "Consensus Check: The cluster presented two distinct verbatim texts. The first (describing vendor cost incurrence scenarios) had full consensus as 'OTHER' (INFO). The second (Zebracorp's general rule on vendor responsibility) had a strong majority (3 out of 4 agents) classifying it as 'GUIDELINE', with one agent classifying a longer version of it as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). Tie-Breaker: The phrase 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes an obligation and a core operating principle, making 'GUIDELINE' the appropriate type. Value Assessment & Self-Sufficiency: The 'GUIDELINE' refers to 'such costs'. To make the 'plain_text' self-sufficient, the context defining these costs (from the first verbatim text in the cluster) was incorporated into the 'plain_text' of the 'GUIDELINE'. This ensures clarity and self-sufficiency without creating a separate Golden Record for the contextual information, adhering to the 'single Golden Record' instruction. Type-Specific Criteria: The 'GUIDELINE' creates a clear, actionable obligation for vendors. The classification 'CRITICAL' is appropriate due to the fundamental nature of this rule in allocating significant financial risk. Utility Check: This 'GUIDELINE' is highly specific and crucial for understanding Zebracorp's default position on component/materials liability, directly impacting negotiations and risk management.",
