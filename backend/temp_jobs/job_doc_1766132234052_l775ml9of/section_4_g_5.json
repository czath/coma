      "rationale": "Consensus: Single candidate classified as 'OTHER' (INFO). Evaluation: The verbatim text 'COMPONENT/MATERIALS LIABILITY' is clearly a heading or topic indicator within a legal document. It is not a rule or a definition itself, but a structural element that signals the content of the subsequent section. The plain_text accurately describes its function, and the expert_insight, implications, and justification provide valuable context regarding the importance of this topic. It passes the clarity, value, and utility checks as a significant structural marker. Therefore, it is accepted as a valid 'OTHER' finding.",
