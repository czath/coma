The second (Candidates 2, 5, 7, 9) describes the characteristics of Zebracorp's standard definition, with agents split between GUIDELINE, DEFINITION, and OTHER (INFO). \n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: Both ideas are clear, self-sufficient, and provide valuable strategic and informational context. The first statement ('Zebracorp prefers a broad definition...') represents a primary strategic stance, while the second ('The Zebracorp standard definition... already narrows...') clarifies the inherent scope of that preferred definition. Given the instruction to consolidate into a single Golden Record, the primary strategic preference is chosen as the core, with the clarifying information integrated into the 'expert_insight' and 'source_insight' fields.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The chosen verbatim expresses a 'preference' and 'encompasses' certain information, which is best classified as 'OTHER' with a 'TACTIC' subtype, as it outlines Zebracorp's strategic approach to defining confidential information in negotiations. It is not a direct definition of 'confidential information' itself, nor is it a direct actionable obligation (GUIDELINE) but rather a strategic position. The 'plain_text' accurately rephrases the chosen verbatim. The 'expert_insight' and 'source_insight' effectively integrate the clarifying context from the second set of candidates, explaining that this 'broad' definition still includes common exclusions.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This record is highly useful for understanding Zebracorp's negotiation strategy regarding confidentiality definitions, helping to protect company information and guide negotiators.",

Evaluation: Candidate 2 provides a more complete and contextualized finding, including the critical implication of the example for Zebracorp's business. This makes the finding self-sufficient and highly actionable, passing the clarity, value, and utility checks. The verbatim text from Candidate 2 accurately captures the example and its justification from the source. Therefore, Candidate 2 is chosen as the basis for the Golden Record.",
