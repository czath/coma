Consequently, anticipate that US-based vendors will seek to replace 'best efforts' with less stringent standards, such as 'commercially reasonable efforts'.",
        "expert_insight": "This insight is critical for negotiation strategy. Understanding the extreme interpretation of 'best efforts' by US lawyers explains why US vendors will proactively seek to replace it with less onerous terms like 'commercially reasonable efforts'.
