        "expert_insight": "This is a core strategic objective for Zebracorp, ensuring business continuity and M&A flexibility without being hampered by individual contract consents. It's crucial for corporate restructuring (M&A, reorganizations) to avoid deal complications, delays, and potential extortion from counterparties. This objective is concretely implemented by allowing Zebracorp to unconditionally assign, novate, delegate, or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations, in whole, in part, or through a splitting of the agreement, to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line without prior supplier consent. This stance is critical because restrictive assignment clauses, especially those requiring consent for transfers by operation of law, complicate M&A transactions, impacting their timing, cost, and the ability to consummate a smooth merger or acquisition.",

It must avoid restrictive clauses to prevent significant complications, delays, and costs in future M&A activities, ensuring efficient execution of corporate strategy.",
        "implication_supplier": "The supplier loses control over who Zebracorp's counterparty might become in certain corporate restructuring scenarios, as their consent is not required. Suppliers should understand that such clauses are highly problematic for Zebracorp's corporate strategy and will be strongly resisted due to their negative impact on M&A, and must accept Zebracorp's right to assign to affiliates or business line acquirers without their consent.",
        "source_insight": "The text explicitly states 'maximum flexibility' and 'at the minimum' for affiliate assignment, indicating a tiered approach to negotiation goals. This objective is further exemplified by Zebracorp's preferred clause allowing unconditional assignment to affiliates or business line acquirers without consent. The rationale is underscored by the impact of restrictive clauses on the timing, cost, and smoothness of M&A transactions."

The text is a clear directive for Zebracorp's negotiation stance, making GUIDELINE the most appropriate type. The classification as CRITICAL/HIGH was consistent among agents. \nValue Assessment: The verbatim text is clear and self-sufficient, stating a fundamental requirement for Zebracorp's operational and strategic agility. The plain_text accurately summarizes this directive. \nType-Specific Criteria: The finding is actionable, creating a specific obligation for Zebracorp to negotiate for these assignment rights. It is complete in its description of the desired flexibility, conditions, and beneficiaries. \nUtility Check: This is a highly useful, strategic directive for Zebracorp's contract negotiations, directly impacting its ability to conduct M&A and reorganizations smoothly. \nConsolidation: The Golden Record is built around the primary guideline stating Zebracorp's objective for maximum assignment flexibility. Insights from the specific preferred clause (Group 2) and the business justifications for this stance (Group 3) have been integrated into the `expert_insight`, `justification`, `implication_company`, `implication_supplier`, and `source_insight` fields to provide a comprehensive and consolidated record of the cluster's findings, as per the instruction to consolidate into a single record.",

Generally, changes in ownership do not require the other contracting party's consent.",
        "expert_insight": "This explains the critical distinction between asset sales and share sales/mergers in M&A regarding contract transfer. It clarifies that while asset sales necessitate individual contract assignments, share acquisitions or mergers generally do not require counterparty consent for contract transfer, as the legal entity remains, only its ownership changes. This addresses a common misconception and is vital for M&A planning.",

This information is highly valuable for M&A strategy. Type-Specific Criteria: The information provides essential context and clarification regarding legal principles in corporate transactions, fitting the 'INFO' subtype. Utility Check: This finding is specific, clarifies a common misconception, and directly helps Zebracorp in negotiating and structuring M&A deals by understanding when consent for contract assignment is or isn't legally necessary. Therefore, it passes all checks and is accepted, with Candidate 2 forming the basis of the golden record due to its completeness.",

Type-Specific Criteria: 'OTHER' (INFO) is appropriate as these are not definitions or actionable guidelines, but rather contextual information about Zebracorp's approach and the reasons behind it.

        "text": "When planning acquisitions or such other corporate transactions, the acquiring party will usually have to consider how it prefers to structure the transactions. The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not ‘assigned’ to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party’s consent."
