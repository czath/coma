        "verbatim_text": "As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs and to be able to fully meet the occasional order cancellation and to meet our forecasted demand (as well as some additional drop-in orders as set forth in the flexibility parameters). The risk that the forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party’s business risk and this also applies to Zebracorp in our sales towards our end customers. In cases where the vendor has many customers for its product, the vendor should have no great issues with assuming such risk.",
        "plain_text": "As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and suppliers to bear costs associated with order cancellations and to meet forecasted demand (including additional drop-in orders as per flexibility parameters). This is because the risk of demand not materializing is typically the selling party's business risk. This expectation is particularly strong when the vendor has multiple customers for its product.",
        "expert_insight": "This establishes Zebracorp's default and strong negotiation position: suppliers bear the risk of unconsumed materials due to cancellations or forecast inaccuracies. It also provides the rationale (selling party's business risk) and a condition (multiple customers) to bolster this stance.",

      "rationale": "Consensus Check: The cluster contained two distinct types of information. The first group (Candidates 2, 4, 6) provided general background information. The second group (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7) focused on Zebracorp's 'general rule' regarding vendor liability. For the 'general rule' group, Agents 1, 5, 7 classified a partial text as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 3 classified a more complete text (including justification) as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). \n\nEvaluation: The introductory paragraph (Candidates 2, 4, 6) is purely descriptive context and does not represent an actionable rule, definition, or specific tactic. While informative, it is not a primary 'finding' in the sense of a contractual obligation or definition. Therefore, it is not included in the Golden Record.\n\nFor the 'general rule' (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7), the most comprehensive verbatim text is from Candidate 3, which includes the rule, its justification, and a condition. The first sentence of this text clearly establishes an expectation/obligation, making it a 'GUIDELINE'. The subsequent sentences provide crucial context and rationale, which are best captured in the `justification` and `conditions` fields of a GUIDELINE type. Therefore, the primary classification is GUIDELINE.\n\nValue Assessment: The selected verbatim text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides a critical rule for liability allocation. It passes the 'So What?' test as it defines a core business risk allocation.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it is actionable, creating a clear expectation for vendors. It is complete, capturing all relevant parts of the paragraph. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given it's explicitly stated as a 'general rule' and dictates a fundamental aspect of vendor liability.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiation, clarifies risk allocation, and protects Zebracorp's interests. It is a valuable item to keep.",
