The risk that the forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party’s business risk and this also applies to Zebracorp in our sales towards our end customers. In cases where the vendor has many customers for its product, the vendor should have no great issues with assuming such risk.",
        "plain_text": "As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and suppliers to bear costs and liability (such as for ordered components/materials, stock built based on forecasts, or costs incurred before firm orders or due to cancellations) that are not recoverable if expected business fails to materialize. Suppliers must be able to fully meet occasional order cancellations and forecasted demand (including additional drop-in orders as per flexibility parameters). Zebracorp considers the risk of unmet forecasts or estimated demand to be the selling party's business risk, especially for vendors with multiple customers.",

      "rationale": "CONSENSUS CHECK: The cluster contained two distinct verbatim texts. The first (Candidates 2, 4, 6) was consistently classified as 'OTHER' (INFO) and provided background context. The second (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7) was about Zebracorp's general rule regarding vendor liability. Agents 1, 5, 7 classified a shorter version of this as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 3 classified a longer version (including justification) as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). \n\nDECISION: The core of the finding is Zebracorp's expectation and obligation placed on the supplier, making it a 'GUIDELINE'. The longer verbatim from Candidate 3 was chosen as the definitive 'verbatim_text' because it fully captures both the rule and its explicit justification, providing complete context. The introductory 'OTHER' (INFO) findings were deemed less critical as standalone actionable items and primarily serve as background for this core guideline, thus rejected to adhere to the 'single Golden Record' output requirement.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The `plain_text` was rewritten to ensure self-sufficiency by clarifying the 'such costs' reference, drawing context from the preceding paragraph in the source text. The guideline is clear, actionable, and crucial for understanding risk allocation.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: As a GUIDELINE, it creates a specific obligation for suppliers to bear certain costs and meet demand. It is complete and classified as 'CRITICAL' due to its fundamental impact on financial risk management.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiation by establishing Zebracorp's default position, and protects the company by shifting risk to the supplier. It is a valuable and essential record.",
