The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not ‘assigned’ to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party’s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open.

In an asset sale, individual contracts require specific assignment and due diligence.

Please speak to a member of the Legal & Compliance team to obtain the appropriate templates/language.

        "text": "In those critical R&D contracts and the like where we do impose these very same assignment restrictions on our suppliers, it would be better to abandon the entire clause than to agree to mutual clause that would restrict Zebracorp from assigning the contract. The fact that Zebracorp is not willing to make these assignment provisions mutual can often be explained to the supplier by the asymmetric contractual relationship i.e. that of the customer and the supplier. In most cases, we can make the contract more palatable to the supplier by agreeing to allow the supplier transfer the contract by operation of law to any party that is not a direct competitor of Zebracorp."
