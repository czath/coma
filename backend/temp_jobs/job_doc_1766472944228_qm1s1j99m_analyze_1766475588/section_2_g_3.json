The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not ‘assigned’ to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party’s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open.",
