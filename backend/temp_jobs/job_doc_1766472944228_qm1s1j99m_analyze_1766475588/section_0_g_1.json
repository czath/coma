The surrounding source text provides ample context and justification for the importance of this guideline, which is well-captured in the expert insights and justifications provided by the agents.\nType-Specific Criteria (GUIDELINE): It is actionable, requiring Zebracorp to exercise 'special care'. It is complete in its statement. It is not generic advice; the source text explicitly details the critical implications of acceptance provisions (revenue recognition, payment triggers, liquidated damages, warranty start dates), justifying a 'HIGH' classification.\nUtility Check: This is a highly useful finding, emphasizing a critical area of contract drafting that directly impacts financial and legal outcomes for Zebracorp.
