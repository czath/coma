Theme 2, concerning the necessity of securing a broad, potentially exclusive, license when Zebracorp does not obtain ownership of Foreground IPR, represents a more direct and critical contractual obligation/action for Zebracorp. It acts as a crucial fallback position to protect Zebracorp's usage rights. The language 'should agree on a broad license' indicates a specific contractual requirement. Candidate 4/5 provides the most complete verbatim text for this theme, including the explanation of exclusive licenses, which is vital context. The type 'GUIDELINE' is appropriate as it dictates a specific action/obligation. The 'plain_text' has been slightly refined for clarity and emphasis on the critical nature of the action. Candidate 8 was a fragment of this same information and is therefore subsumed.
