According to the type-specific criteria, generic advice ('Draft with care') is reclassified as 'OTHER' with subtype 'INSTRUCTION'. \nValue Assessment: The plain text is clear and self-sufficient. The source text immediately provides the crucial context and justification for this instruction, which has been incorporated into the 'justification' field. \nUtility Check: This is a highly useful instruction, emphasizing the critical nature of acceptance provisions for various contractual aspects (payment, warranty, completion, risk mitigation).

All agents agreed on the critical nature of this finding. Evaluation: The finding is actionable, self-sufficient, and creates a specific obligation for Zebracorp to align subcontractor acceptance with customer contracts in specific project scenarios. It directly addresses a critical risk of financial exposure and contractual misalignment. Passed Clarity, Value, Necessity, and Utility checks.
