We should however be very careful in accepting such general limitation periods. We may not have such limitations periods agreed with our end customers. In e.g. IPR claims can emerge whenever the products are in use. Same can be said about product safety issues (where the risk of claims emerging may in fact increase over time).",
        "plain_text": "Zebracorp must exercise extreme caution when accepting general contractual limitation periods that prevent the purchasing party from bringing any claims whatsoever after their expiry. This is crucial as such limitations may not align with agreements with end customers, and long-tail liabilities like IPR infringement or product safety claims can emerge much later, potentially increasing over time.",
        "expert_insight": "This is a critical strategic warning. Accepting broad, general limitation periods from suppliers can create a significant back-to-back liability mismatch if Zebracorp's own customer contracts lack similar limits. Such clauses severely restrict Zebracorp's recourse for long-tail liabilities like IPR infringement or product safety, which may not manifest for many years and whose risk can even increase over time.",

        "implication_company": "Accepting general limitation periods could significantly limit Zebracorp's ability to recover damages for latent defects or long-term liabilities (e.g., IPR, product safety), potentially leaving it exposed to claims from end customers without recourse to suppliers. Resisting these protects Zebracorp's future claim rights and prevents unintended forfeiture of critical claims.",
        "implication_supplier": "Suppliers would benefit from such general limitation periods as it caps their overall liability exposure, but they should anticipate strong resistance from Zebracorp, particularly for claims related to IPR and product safety, which have delayed manifestation.",
        "source_insight": "The text provides a clear instruction to 'be very careful' and highlights that IPR and product safety claims can emerge whenever products are in use, with the risk of product safety claims potentially increasing over time, making general limitation periods particularly risky and justifying the caution."

The plain_text was carefully crafted to be self-sufficient, explaining the nature of these periods and the comprehensive rationale for caution. Type-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it is highly actionable, creating a specific obligation for caution. It is not generic advice. The significant implications for Zebracorp (potential back-to-back liability, exposure to long-tail risks like IPR and product safety) warrant a 'CRITICAL' classification. Utility Check: This is a crucial finding that directly aids Zebracorp in contract negotiation and protects against significant future liabilities. All checks passed.",

In fact, such an approach is very common in project construction contracts. It is however worth noting that such limitation periods for submitting invoices may be subject to a reasonableness test under the legal provisions preventing unfair contract terms in many jurisdictions. This means that courts might be unwilling uphold a very short limitation period if it was deemed unfair or unreasonable for the selling party. For contracts governed by NY USA laws, courts in New York USA would be likely to uphold even very short limitation periods as long our purchasing agreement was between commercial entities of equal or substantially equal bargaining strength and the terms of the contract were negotiated (and not based on in e.g. our standard pre-printed terms & conditions). The same can said to apply in many other jurisdictions such as in e.g. the UK.",

However, such limitation periods may be subject to a 'reasonableness test' in many jurisdictions, meaning courts might not uphold very short or unfair periods. In New York, USA, courts are more likely to uphold short limitation periods if the agreement is between commercial entities of equal bargaining strength and the terms were negotiated, a principle also applicable in other jurisdictions like the UK.",

Crucially, the subsequent sentences immediately introduce significant legal caveats regarding 'reasonableness tests' and jurisdictional differences (NY, UK) that impact the enforceability of such deadlines. This comprehensive discussion of a strategic option, its benefits, commonality, and critical legal considerations makes 'OTHER' with subtype 'TACTIC' the most appropriate classification, as it describes a strategic approach with necessary caveats for implementation.\n\nCandidate 2 provides the most complete and self-sufficient 'verbatim_text' and 'plain_text' by including all the essential context about the 'reasonableness test' and jurisdictional specifics. The shorter candidates, while identifying a core idea, omit critical information necessary for a full understanding and actionable insight. The 'plain_text' from Candidate 2 is clear, concise, and captures the full nuance of the source text.\n\nPassed Value Test: The finding is highly valuable as it informs Zebracorp about a potential financial management tactic and the crucial legal considerations for its implementation, helping to avoid unenforceable clauses. It is specific and helps a human negotiate better by understanding the legal landscape.\n\nDecision: The finding is valid and classified as 'OTHER' (TACTIC) due to its strategic nature and the inclusion of vital legal context.",

The Supreme Judge rules in favor of 'DEFINITION' as it explicitly defines a key legal term. For the second concept (start date of statutory limitation periods), all agents classified it as 'OTHER' (Candidates 2, 5, 7). \n\nValue Assessment: Both concepts passed the clarity and self-sufficiency tests. The definition of 'Limitation Period' is clear and foundational. The explanation of the start date for statutory limitation periods is also clear and provides crucial context.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The definition is accurate and necessary, defining a specific legal term rather than a common word. The explanation of the start date is informative and correctly classified as 'OTHER' (INFO).\n\nUtility Check: Both findings are highly useful. The definition is fundamental for understanding contractual obligations, and the explanation of the start date is critical for accurate calculation of claim periods.\n\nFinal Decision: The prompt requires a single JSON object for the Golden Record. Given the presence of two distinct, valid findings within the cluster, the Supreme Judge prioritizes the foundational definition of 'Limitation Period' as the primary Golden Record. While the information regarding the commencement of statutory limitation periods is also valid and important, it is considered a specific detail related to one type of limitation period, making the general definition the more overarching and representative finding for a single Golden Record.",
