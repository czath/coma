The most actionable and comprehensive finding is the imperative to include the clause, which is a GUIDELINE. The definition and the explanation of risk serve as crucial context and justification for this guideline. The 'plain_text' for the guideline is self-sufficient, implicitly covering the clause's function.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The consolidated record is classified as a GUIDELINE because the source text states severability clauses 'are important to be included' and details the critical negative consequences of their absence. This creates a specific, actionable obligation for contract drafting. It is not generic advice. The definition is integrated into the 'plain_text' and 'expert_insight' for completeness.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific and directly helps in contract drafting and negotiation by highlighting a critical protective measure and its rationale. It clarifies a key contractual term and protects the company from significant legal risks.",
