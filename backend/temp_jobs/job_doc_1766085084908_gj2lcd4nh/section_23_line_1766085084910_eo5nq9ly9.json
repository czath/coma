It creates a specific obligation for suppliers and a specific action for Zebracorp. Therefore, it is best classified as a GUIDELINE.

Completeness: Yes, the statement is complete. Classification: It's a specific rule, not generic advice, and is critical because it enforces a core company policy.\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific and helps both Zebracorp (by enforcing policy) and suppliers (by clarifying requirements for payment).
