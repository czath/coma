This text describes the content of Zebracorp's standard definition.\n\nValue Assessment: Both findings are clear, self-sufficient, and provide valuable context. However, the prompt explicitly requests a *single* JSON object for the Golden Record. Therefore, the most prominent and actionable finding, which sets Zebracorp's strategic direction, was selected.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The selected finding (VT1) is a GUIDELINE. It is actionable, creating a specific obligation/directive for Zebracorp's negotiators to seek a broad definition.

It is not filler.\n\nDecision: The finding regarding Zebracorp's preference for a broad definition (VT1) is chosen as the Golden Record due to its nature as a primary strategic directive, which is more actionable than the descriptive detail of the standard definition (VT2) when only one record can be returned.",

It refers to 'the above list' which is clearly the list of exclusions from confidential information mentioned immediately prior in the source text.\nType-Specific Criteria: The phrase 'we should not have an issue with expanding' indicates a recommended negotiation stance or an internal policy on flexibility, rather than a strict contractual obligation or right. This aligns more closely with a 'TACTIC' (a type of 'OTHER' finding) that guides Zebracorp's approach in negotiations, rather than a 'GUIDELINE' which typically dictates a specific contractual term or action. It's advice on what to accept if requested, not a direct rule to be implemented.\nUtility Check: This finding is highly useful as it informs Zebracorp's negotiation strategy, indicating areas of flexibility and common ground with suppliers/subcontractors, which can facilitate contract finalization and build goodwill.",

Having a specific obligation to label all materials including all oral disclosures as confidential is very difficult to adhere to in practice. It is by no means customary within the industry to summarize each discussion with details on items that should be kept in confidence. In fact the parties are likely to rely on being able to discuss matters freely in reliance that an NDA/confidentiality undertaking is in place to protect the confidentiality of the discussions. Removing this type of a requirement ultimately benefits both parties since this requirement may result in confidential information of a party to be inadvertently made public information."

Having a specific obligation to label all materials including all oral disclosures as confidential is very difficult to adhere to in practice. It is by no means customary within the industry to summarize each discussion with details on items that should be kept in confidence. In fact the parties are likely to rely on being able to discuss matters freely in reliance that an NDA/confidentiality undertaking is in place to protect the confidentiality of the discussions. Removing this type of a requirement ultimately benefits both parties since this requirement may result in confidential information of a party to be inadvertently made public information."
