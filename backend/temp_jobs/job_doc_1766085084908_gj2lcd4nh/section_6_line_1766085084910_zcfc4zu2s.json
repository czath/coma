      "rationale": "Consensus: All agents correctly identified the finding as 'OTHER' with 'INSTRUCTION' subtype. Evaluation: The verbatim text is a clear cross-reference. The plain text is self-sufficient and accurately conveys the instruction. The finding passes the Value and Utility checks as it provides crucial navigational information for understanding the treatment of consequential damages within the document. Candidate 1's verbatim_text was incomplete, so the full verbatim_text from the source (and candidates 2 & 3) was used. All other fields were synthesized from the strongest aspects of the candidates.",
