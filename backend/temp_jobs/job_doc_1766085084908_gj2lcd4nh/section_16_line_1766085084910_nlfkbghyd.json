So the liability cap is really only relevant when facing a IPR infringement claim.

Whilst these type of events can arguably cause indirect damages in the form of loss of revenue, these event can also cause direct damages. Instead of listing these as ‘indirect’ damage, we should consider expanding the list of ‘indirect’ damages to expressly include loss of profit, loss of business and loss of revenue. The aforesaid also applies for the items: ‘loss of product’, ‘loss of data or information’ and ‘loss of use of an asset’."
