Securing these broad assignment rights is crucial to avoid deal complications, delays, and potential extortion from counterparties, minimizing future operational friction. The preferred assignment clause (e.g., 'However, [Zebracorp] may, without the prior written consent of the [Supplier], unconditionally assign... to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line...') directly implements this guideline.",

Agent 1 also identified a related, specific clause (Candidate 2) as a GUIDELINE.\nEvaluation: The chosen verbatim text (from Candidates 1, 3, 4, 5) sets a critical objective for Zebracorp's contract negotiations regarding assignment flexibility. It is actionable, specific, and essential for corporate agility. The `plain_text` has been rewritten to include the necessary context for 'these reasons' from the preceding source text, ensuring self-sufficiency. The classification as CRITICAL is justified by the emphasis on 'maximum flexibility' and the stated risks of not achieving it.

The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not ‘assigned’ to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.
