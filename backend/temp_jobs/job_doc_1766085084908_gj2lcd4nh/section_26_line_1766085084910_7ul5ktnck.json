The plain_text has been contextualized to make it self-sufficient by explicitly linking 'Such limitations' to 'contractual limitations on liability for punitive damages'.\nType-Specific Criteria: While not a strict obligation, the phrase 'can be generally accepted' provides strong guidance on a recommended commercial stance and negotiation strategy regarding a specific contractual clause.
