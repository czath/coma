Agents 1, 4, and 5 classified shorter, embedded sentences as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 2 classified a more comprehensive block of text (Candidate 3) as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). Evaluation: Candidate 3 provides a complete tactical instruction, including the justification (lack of IPR protection in OSS licenses), the specific rule (conditional acceptance of OSS terms for indemnity/warranty), and the strategic objective (preventing reduced supplier liability). This comprehensive approach makes it more self-sufficient and actionable than the isolated 'GUIDELINE' statements. The 'OTHER' (TACTIC) classification is therefore more appropriate for this finding. It passes the Value, Type-Specific, and Utility checks as it offers critical negotiation guidance and risk mitigation for Zebracorp. While Candidate 4 also presents a valid and important tactical instruction, Candidate 3 addresses the foundational issue of IPR protection and supplier liability, making it the most critical and encompassing finding within this cluster.",
