Value Assessment: The text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides crucial navigational context regarding the location of arbitration details. It passes the 'So What?' test by directing users to essential information. Type-Specific Criteria: As an 'OTHER' (Instruction), it accurately serves as a cross-reference within the document. The 'plain_text' is well-contextualized. Utility Check: This finding is highly useful as it guides readers to the specific section detailing arbitration, which is a critical contractual element. The full 'verbatim_text' from Agent 2 and 3, including 'ARBITRATION', provides complete context.",
