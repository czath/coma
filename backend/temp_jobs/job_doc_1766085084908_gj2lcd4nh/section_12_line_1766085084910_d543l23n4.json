For sellers, excluding indirect and consequential damages is crucial to prevent exposure to potentially vast and unforeseeable losses (e.g., lost profits, business interruption) that can far exceed the contract value. For buyers, it means understanding that certain significant losses may not be recoverable, necessitating alternative risk mitigation strategies like insurance or specific performance clauses.
