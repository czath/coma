Evaluation: The selected verbatim text explicitly states Zebracorp's 'Preferred Position' for IPR indemnity, outlining a specific, actionable goal for negotiations (full, unlimited indemnity).

        "verbatim_text": "A number of vendors will seek to limit the indemnity to damages that are ‘finally awarded’ by in e.g. saying that they will indemnify against any “damages finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction against [Zebracorp]”. This qualifier changes the scope of the indemnity dramatically as it limits the indemnity solely to those damages that a court would order Zebracorp to pay to the third party claimant. Essentially the claim would not only have to be made by the third party claimant but subsequently litigated, and the judgment must be final before the vendor would incur any obligation to compensate us for the damages we have incurred. This leaves a substantial amount of damages and costs out of the indemnity and is only rarely acceptable. This is because most IP lawsuits hardly ever reach a point of final court order but are settled. Zebracorp is also likely to incur costs and damages as a result of in e.g. obtaining replacement products, experiencing production stoppages and order cancellations, customer claims and attorneys fees. If we do exceptionally agree to limit the indemnity to finally awarded damages we should specify that this final award can be either through arbitration or local court and that the supplier will also pay for any sums agreed in a settlement. Also we should insert a provision to specify the supplier’s obligations and liability in the event there is an injunction (i.e. a court order prohibiting ZEBRACORP or its customers from using or distributing the allegedly infringing products/services). Special attention should also be give to the ancillary obligations of the supplier (see section below) to make sure that the supplier has sufficient incentive to seek quick resolution by either providing a non-infringing replacing product and by obtaining a license from the third party claimant). Also we should seek to secure a right to be compensated for our legal fees. It is recommended to consult a member of the Legal & Compliance team in drafting the provision.",
        "plain_text": "Zebracorp should rarely accept indemnity limited to 'finally awarded' damages, as this dramatically narrows coverage, excluding settlement costs and other significant business damages (e.g., replacement products, stoppages, customer claims, legal fees) common in IP disputes. If exceptionally accepted, it must include arbitration awards, court judgments, and settlement sums, and specifically address supplier obligations during injunctions. Ensure supplier incentives for quick resolution and secure compensation for Zebracorp's legal fees. Consult Legal & Compliance for drafting such provisions.",
        "expert_insight": "This is a critical point of negotiation. Limiting indemnity to 'finally awarded' damages severely undermines Zebracorp's protection, as most IP cases settle and Zebracorp incurs substantial costs beyond direct court-ordered payments.

Ideally we should undertake to inform the supplier of the claim “within a reasonable time period”. If this is rejected by the supplier, we could agree to inform “without any undue delay”. However, we should not agree to wording such as “immediately” or “promptly” as any inadvertent delay may give the supplier a case for trying to walk away from the entire indemnity obligation. In the event the supplier is adamant about using the words “promptly” or “immediately”, we should consider adding in e.g. the following clarifying language: “failure by the [buyer] to inform the [supplier] of any claim in a timely manner will only affect the obligations of the [supplier] if and to the extent the [supplier] is directly prejudiced as a result of such delay”."
