Candidate 1 captures the full scope of the instruction, including the nuance about Zebracorp potentially paying for initial shipment in certain cases, which the other candidates miss by only extracting the first sentence. The finding passes the Clarity, Value, Necessity, and Utility checks. Classified as a Critical Guideline due to its impact on cost allocation and negotiation strategy.",
