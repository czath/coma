Evaluation: The verbatim text 'This should be taken into account' refers to the preceding sentence in the source text regarding LDs being tied to the value of delayed products. The chosen 'plain_text' successfully contextualizes 'This' to make the instruction self-sufficient and clear. The instruction is specific and actionable, guiding the financial assessment of LDs based on their calculation method. It passes the Value and Utility checks, providing important guidance for financial impact assessment. Classified as an 'OTHER' (Instruction).",
