My decision is 'GUIDELINE' due to the strong prescriptive language ('cannot risk', 'may be essential') which indicates a direct obligation and right for Zebracorp. Candidates 2, 4, and 7, concerning the helpfulness of spelling out TFC conditions, were split between 'GUIDELINE' and 'OTHER' (TACTIC). My decision for these would be 'OTHER' (TACTIC) as 'may be helpful' suggests advice rather than a strict rule. Candidates 5 and 8, providing an example of TFC conditions, had consensus as 'OTHER' (EXAMPLE). \n\nValue Assessment: All candidates are clear, self-sufficient, and accurately reflect the source text without dangling references. \n\nType-Specific Criteria: For the primary finding (Zebracorp's TFC rights), classifying it as a 'GUIDELINE' is appropriate because it creates a specific obligation (not to grant TFC to suppliers) and a specific right (to have TFC for itself). The language is actionable and complete. The 'CRITICAL' classification is justified by the phrases 'cannot risk' and 'may be essential'. The other findings, while valid, are secondary (tactical advice and an example) and do not represent the core directive as strongly as this guideline. \n\nUtility Check: This guideline is highly specific, helps Zebracorp negotiate better, clarifies a critical contractual position, and protects the company's strategic development projects. It is not filler. \n\nConsolidation: The Golden Record consolidates the core directive from Candidates 1, 3, and 6, synthesizing their plain text, expert insights, justifications, and implications into a single, comprehensive 'GUIDELINE' record.",

For the second verbatim, 'A compromise position can also be found by...', there was a split between GUIDELINE and OTHER (TACTIC). Evaluation: Both verbatim texts represent valid negotiation points or concessions regarding ramp-down periods. However, the instruction requires a single Golden Record. The second verbatim, describing the exclusion of new purchase orders during ramp-down, is a distinct and impactful negotiation tactic. It provides a clear boundary for Zebracorp's activities during this period, making it a strong candidate for a 'tactic' type. The phrasing 'A compromise position can also be found by...' supports its classification as an 'OTHER' type with 'TACTIC' subtype, rather than a direct 'GUIDELINE'. Both passed the Value and Utility checks. The second verbatim was chosen as the single Golden Record due to its clear articulation as a 'compromise position' and its direct applicability as a negotiation tactic.",
