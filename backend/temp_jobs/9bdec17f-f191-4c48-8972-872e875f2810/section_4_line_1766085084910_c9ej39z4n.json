The risk that the forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party’s business risk and this also applies to Zebracorp in our sales towards our end customers. In cases where the vendor has many customers for its product, the vendor should have no great issues with assuming such risk.",
        "plain_text": "Zebracorp's general rule is that vendors and suppliers are expected to bear costs associated with order cancellations and meeting forecasted demand, including additional 'drop-in' orders within agreed flexibility parameters. The risk of unmaterialized forecasts or estimated demand is considered the selling party's business risk, a principle that also applies to Zebracorp's own sales. Vendors with multiple customers for a product are expected to manage this risk without significant issues.",
        "expert_insight": "This establishes Zebracorp's default and strong negotiating position regarding component/materials liability. It explicitly states that suppliers are generally responsible for costs incurred due to order cancellations, unmaterialized forecasts, and accommodating flexible demand. The text further provides a tactical justification, framing these risks as standard 'selling party's business risk' and suggesting that diversified suppliers should readily assume them. This minimizes Zebracorp's financial exposure and shifts the burden of inventory and production risk to the supplier, especially in scenarios where vendors incur costs before firm orders or based on forecasts.",

      "rationale": "Consensus Check: The cluster presented two distinct types of findings. The first paragraph (Candidates 2, 4, 6) describes the general context of vendor risk (INFO). The subsequent paragraph (Candidate 3, which includes the text from Candidates 1, 5, 7) outlines Zebracorp's 'general rule' regarding liability. Given the instruction to return a single Golden Record, the most actionable and contractually significant element, the 'general rule,' was prioritized. Agents 1, 5, and 7 classified the core expectation as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 3 classified the entire paragraph as OTHER (TACTIC). The Supreme Judge determined that the core statement 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' constitutes a clear obligation/expectation, thus classifying it as a GUIDELINE. The subsequent sentences in the paragraph provide strong justification and tactical advice for this guideline, which are incorporated into the `plain_text`, `expert_insight`, and `justification` fields.\n\nValue Assessment: The chosen `verbatim_text` is self-sufficient, clearly stating Zebracorp's default position on liability and providing the rationale. The `plain_text` and `expert_insight` are comprehensive and contextualized.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The finding creates a specific obligation for suppliers regarding cost bearing and demand fulfillment, making it an actionable GUIDELINE. It is classified as CRITICAL due to its fundamental impact on risk allocation and financial responsibility.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, helps Zebracorp negotiate effectively by establishing a strong default position, and protects the company by shifting significant financial risk to suppliers. Therefore, it passes the utility check.",
