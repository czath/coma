According to the type-specific criteria, generic advice ('Review carefully', 'Draft with care') must be reclassified to `OTHER` (Instruction) and never `GUIDELINE`.

The first finding (Candidates 1, 3, 4, 6) was more detailed, with 3 agents classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' (CRITICAL) and 1 as 'OTHER' (INSTRUCTION). The second finding (Candidates 2, 5, 7) was unanimously classified as 'GUIDELINE' (CRITICAL). I chose the more detailed verbatim text from the first group as the basis for the Golden Record, as it provides explicit justification within the text. As a tie-breaker for the type, I classified it as 'GUIDELINE' because the phrase 'would need to be aligned... in order to ensure' establishes a specific, mandatory contractual obligation for Zebracorp, rather than merely general advice or an internal instruction. The 'CRITICAL' classification is consistent across all agents who identified it as a Guideline.\nValue Assessment: The verbatim text is clear and self-sufficient, providing the specific conditions and the rationale for the required alignment. The plain_text, expert_insight, and other fields have been synthesized from the best elements of all relevant candidates to ensure maximum clarity and completeness.\nType-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it is highly actionable, creating a specific obligation for Zebracorp to structure its contracts in a particular way. It is complete and correctly classified as CRITICAL due to the significant financial and contractual risks associated with misaligned acceptance provisions.\nUtility Check: This finding is specific, directly aids in contract negotiation, and is crucial for protecting Zebracorp from financial exposure and ensuring contractual consistency. It passes all utility checks.",
