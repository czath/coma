      "rationale": "Consensus: All agents identified the finding as 'OTHER'. Subtype was split between 'INFO' and 'INSTRUCTION'. The text 'Please refer to...' is a clear directive, thus 'INSTRUCTION' is the more accurate classification. Evaluation: The finding is a clear, self-sufficient instruction directing the reader to another section for details on 'Consequential Damages'. The 'plain_text' correctly contextualizes the instruction by incorporating the heading. It passes the Value and Utility tests as it provides crucial navigational information for understanding key contractual terms. The verbatim text from Candidates 2 and 3 is more complete and accurate.",
