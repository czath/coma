Do not accept a definition that merely states an event is 'beyond the reasonable control' of a seller, as this allows suppliers to claim Force Majeure for foreseeable, avoidable, or surmountable events.",

      "rationale": "CONSENSUS CHECK: The cluster contains two distinct, critical guidelines. The first set of candidates (1, 4, 6) focuses on the general 'beyond reasonable control' definition, with all agents classifying it as a CRITICAL GUIDELINE. The second set (2, 3, 5, 7) focuses on 'third party actions', with a split between GUIDELINE (Agents 1, 4, 5) and OTHER (Agent 2). \n\nEVALUATION: Both findings are valid, clear, actionable, and critical. However, the instruction is to consolidate into a *single* Golden Record. As these are two distinct rules with different verbatim texts, they cannot be perfectly merged into one record without violating the 'verbatim_text must be exact' rule or creating an overly complex, less precise record. Therefore, I must select the most foundational and general guideline from the cluster.\n\nThe guideline concerning the general definition of Force Majeure as merely 'beyond reasonable control' (Candidates 1, 4, 6) is more fundamental to the overall structure and intent of a Force Majeure clause. The 'third party actions' guideline, while critical, is a specific example of a vague term to avoid within that broader definition. Thus, the 'beyond reasonable control' guideline is chosen as the primary Golden Record.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The chosen guideline is clear, self-sufficient, and directly actionable, providing a critical instruction for contract negotiation. It passes the 'So What?' test by highlighting a significant risk and providing a clear directive to mitigate it.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: It creates a specific obligation (what not to accept) and is highly actionable. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified by the source text's explicit warning ('It would not be acceptable') and detailed explanation of the severe implications for the company.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This item is highly specific and directly helps a human negotiate better by preventing a major loophole, thereby protecting the company.",
