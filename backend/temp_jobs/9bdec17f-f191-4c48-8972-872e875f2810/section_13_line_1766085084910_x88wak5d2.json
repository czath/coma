      "rationale": "Consensus Check: Agents were split between 'GUIDELINE' and 'OTHER' (Instruction). I acted as tie-breaker, classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' because the statements are specific, actionable directives for contractual terms, not generic advice. Value Assessment: The verbatim text is clear and the plain text is self-sufficient. The expert insight and justification are robust, drawing from the surrounding context in the source text, particularly the rationale for Zebracorp's expectation of unrestricted rights. Type-Specific Criteria (GUIDELINE): It is actionable ('important to agree on ownership') and complete. The 'CRITICAL' classification is appropriate given the financial investment and the need for unrestricted rights. Utility Check: This is a highly specific and valuable guideline for contract negotiation, directly protecting Zebracorp's interests.\n\nConsolidation Strategy: The cluster contained two closely related guidelines. The first (e.g., Candidate 1) focused on 'development agreements or any such agreements where the supplier is contracted to deliver certain work results (e.g., consultancy agreements)'. The second (e.g., Candidate 8) focused on 'professional services such as design/development work, consulting work, integration work or customizations'. The second statement is more encompassing, covering a broader range of services that include the types of work results mentioned in the first. It also immediately follows with the core justification for Zebracorp's position. Therefore, I consolidated these into a single, comprehensive 'GUIDELINE' based on the second statement, integrating the insights and justifications from both to create a stronger Golden Record.",

This frames the content as a strategic approach or 'tactic' that includes an 'example' clause.
