It constitutes a specific, actionable directive for contract negotiation, creating an obligation for caution when encountering these clauses. Therefore, it is best classified as a 'GUIDELINE'. It passes the Clarity & Context test as it is self-sufficient and clearly explains the 'what' and 'why'. It passes the Actionability test by providing a clear directive for behavior during negotiations. It is highly useful as it helps negotiators avoid significant contractual risks. The 'source of confusion' aspect, while true, is a symptom of the core problem (vagueness and lack of firm commitment) and is less critical than the direct warning and instruction, thus it was not prioritized for the single Golden Record.",
