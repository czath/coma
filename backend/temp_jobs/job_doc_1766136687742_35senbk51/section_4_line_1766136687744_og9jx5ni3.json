The risk that the forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party’s business risk and this also applies to Zebracorp in our sales towards our end customers. In cases where the vendor has many customers for its product, the vendor should have no great issues with assuming such risk.",
        "plain_text": "Zebracorp generally expects its vendors to bear costs associated with order cancellations and meeting forecasted demand, including additional drop-in orders. The risk of unmet forecasts or estimated demand is typically the selling party's business risk, a principle that also applies to Zebracorp's own sales. Vendors with multiple customers for a product are expected to manage this risk without significant issues.",

This is a foundational principle to uphold in discussions, especially for suppliers with diversified customer bases, and sets the baseline for any exceptions to Zebracorp's liability.",

      "rationale": "CONSENSUS CHECK: The cluster presented two distinct types of information: introductory context (Candidates 2, 4, 6, all classified as OTHER/INFO) and Zebracorp's general rule on liability (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7, with a split between GUIDELINE and OTHER/INFO, and varying verbatim text lengths). For the general rule, Agents 1, 5, and 7 correctly identified it as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 2 classified it as OTHER/INFO. Agent 4 also classified it as GUIDELINE but included more context. The longer verbatim text (from Candidates 3 and 5) provides a more complete and self-sufficient statement of the rule, including its justification.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The selected GUIDELINE text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides both the core expectation and its underlying rationale. It does not contain dangling references.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The statement 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes a specific obligation and risk allocation for vendors, making it a GUIDELINE. It is not generic advice. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given its role as the default position for liability.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This finding is highly specific and actionable, directly informing Zebracorp's default stance on component/materials liability. It is crucial for negotiating supplier agreements and managing financial risk. While the introductory context (OTHER/INFO) was also valuable, the prompt requires a single Golden Record. The GUIDELINE represents the primary, actionable legal finding derived from this cluster, making it the most salient record for a legal analysis system. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is chosen as the Golden Record, and the contextual information is implicitly covered by the 'justification' and 'expert_insight' fields.",
