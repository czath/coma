DEBUG LOG STARTED


--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

Acceptance provisions are essential since they ultimately define whether the works rendered by the subcontractor meet the mutually agreed requirements, and when these works have been completed enabling the supplier/subcontractor to recognize revenue. Acceptance generally triggers the right for the subcontractor to invoice and get paid for its deliverables and it can stop the liquidated damages clock. Moreover, the majority of contracts stipulate that the warranty starts to run from the date of acceptance. In cases where the subcontractor is working directly for Zebracorp in a particular customer project, the acceptance provisions would need to be aligned with the corresponding provisions of our customer contract in order to ensure that acceptance is not granted to the subcontractor before securing acceptance from the end customer.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 11, "text": "Acceptance provisions are likely to have less relevance in those global sourcing contracts where the supplier is not delivering directly anything to Zebracorp\u2019s customers and where the supplier payments are not tied to acceptance but where payments are triggered in e.g. by the delivery of materials or products to Zebracorp global hubs. Zebracorp uses these type of contracts with practically all of its component suppliers and the majority of its global OEM vendors.

The subcontractor/supplier should inform Zebracorp when the results of works or other deliverables are ready for acceptance i.e. for acceptance tests and verification. This acceptance test period is usually limited to a certain number of weeks following receipt of the product. The range of acceptance periods usually varies between 20-60 days, with the majority of contracts having a 30-day period. System level testing may require longer testing period. Absent a contractually agreed acceptance period, acceptance may be governed by applicable laws. In e. g. section 2-606 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) provides that acceptance is deemed to occur when the buyer fails to reject the goods within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 14, "text": "In most cases the supplier/subcontractor should be allowed to participate in the site level acceptance tests.

Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests. The acceptance procedure may define a two-step acceptance in the form of provisional acceptance followed up by final acceptance. Provisional acceptance is often granted at the point in time when the deliverables substantially meet the agreed acceptance criteria.

It is however recommended to verify that such deemed acceptance or backstop dates are also agreed in our corresponding customer contract (if applicable) to make sure the acceptance provisions are back-to-back. It is also worth checking with the respective project manager that Zebracorp has sufficient time to complete system level testing before any deemed acceptance is being triggered. When agreeing on a backstop date for completing the acceptance test, we should ensure that acceptance is not triggered, if the delay in completing the acceptance tests is not caused by reasons solely attributable to ZEBRACORP. Any deficiencies, errors or deviations found in the subcontractor\u2019s performance should automatically result in an extension of time for completing the acceptance tests. Also it is always recommended to have the subcontractor agree to send a final formal written notice to us and agree to give us a reasonable cure period before granting deemed acceptance.

Such subjective or unilateral criteria can, with the assistance of Zebracorp product line or customer team, be replaced by objective and clearly defined acceptance criteria.

In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.

This is largely due to the fact that these type of provisions are likely to cause complications when planning mergers, acquisitions or such other transactions. For example, if Zebracorp was planning on forming a merger with another company, we would work from the assumption that our contracts with our suppliers/subcontractors would be automatically transferred to the new merged entity by operation of law without the need seek consents from our supplier base. An assignment restriction described above is likely to impact the timing, cost and our ability to consummate a \"smooth\" merger or such other transaction. In those critical R&D contracts and the like where we do impose these very same assignment restrictions on our suppliers, it would be better to abandon the entire clause than to agree to mutual clause that would restrict Zebracorp from assigning the contract. The fact that Zebracorp is not willing to make these assignment provisions mutual can often be explained to the supplier by the asymmetric contractual relationship i.e. that of the customer and the supplier.

Under UK laws, an assignment of rights under a contract is normally restricted solely to the benefits of the contract. Where a party wishes to transfer both the benefit and burden of the contract without any residual liability (as is usually the case), the assignment of the contract would generally needs to be done by way of a novation. For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Please speak to a member of the Legal & Compliance team to obtain the appropriate templates/language. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment.

This is in stark contrast to some of the common law countries where these phrases have more binding nature. The view generally held by many US lawyers is that party promising to do \u2018best efforts\u2019 is required to do everything in its power to accomplish the target even if it bankrupts itself in the process. You should therefore expect in particular US based vendors to replace \u2018best efforts\u2019 with less onerous efforts standards such as in e.g. \u2018commercial reasonable efforts\u2019.

As an example, when a supplier is hesitant as to whether it can comply with in e.g. all of the Zebracorp quality requirements or Zebracorp environmental requirements, it would be recommend to ask the supplier to identify which specific requirements the supplier is unable to meet and revise those as needed, instead of simply saying that the supplier will use best efforts or commercially reasonable effort to meet such requirements. The odds are that the supplier has no issues in committing itself to the majority of the requirements but only has reservations on some of the requirements. By requiring the supplier to identify those requirements that the supplier is unable to comply with, we often receive valuable information on the technical and other capabilities of the supplier products/solutions - information which would be lost if we merely accept the \u2018best effort\u2019 qualifier.", "style": "Normal"}]

--- END RESPONSE ---


--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

In each case the intent of the phrase is to remove the absolute duty or commitment to accomplish certain specific obligation or target. Understandably these phrases are often introduced by vendors in an attempt to soften their liability to meet some of the obligations that a purchasing agreement imposes on such vendors.

Failure to accomplish such best efforts obligation would generally not be a breach of contract. This is because these phrases are considered too vague to create a binding enforceable obligation. This is in stark contrast to some of the common law countries where these phrases have more binding nature. The view generally held by many US lawyers is that party promising to do \u2018best efforts\u2019 is required to do everything in its power to accomplish the target even if it bankrupts itself in the process. You should therefore expect in particular US based vendors to replace \u2018best efforts\u2019 with less onerous efforts standards such as in e.g. \u2018commercial reasonable efforts\u2019.

Hence, we should, despite their prevalence, be careful in accepting such phrases. As an example, when a supplier is hesitant as to whether it can comply with in e.g. all of the Zebracorp quality requirements or Zebracorp environmental requirements, it would be recommend to ask the supplier to identify which specific requirements the supplier is unable to meet and revise those as needed, instead of simply saying that the supplier will use best efforts or commercially reasonable effort to meet such requirements. The odds are that the supplier has no issues in committing itself to the majority of the requirements but only has reservations on some of the requirements. By requiring the supplier to identify those requirements that the supplier is unable to comply with, we often receive valuable information on the technical and other capabilities of the supplier products/solutions - information which would be lost if we merely accept the \u2018best effort\u2019 qualifier.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 50, "text": "In the event the supplier/subcontractor does insist on using the phrase \u2018commercially reasonable efforts\u2019 in the context of obligations that should by their nature be fulfilled with a certain degree of firm commitment, a compromise can sometimes be found by specifying what the parties mean by this phrase. This can be done in e.g. by adding: \u201cFor the purposes hereof the term \u2018commercially reasonable efforts\u2019 means, with respect to a given goal, the efforts that a professional and diligent company would use and undertake so as to achieve that goal as expeditiously as possible and excludes any action or expenditure that would be unreasonably disproportionate or burdensome to achieve such goal\u201d.

--- END RESPONSE ---


--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

The enforceability of court judgement/arbitration award is major consideration in determining the appropriate dispute resolution form and venue. As an example, if Zebracorp and the supplier have agreed to settle their disputes in local courts as opposed to arbitration and, subsequent to a dispute, Zebracorp prevails in such dispute and obtains a court decision where the supplier is ordered to pay damages to Zebracorp, the enforcement of the local court decision may meet unexpected obstacles. If the supplier is not resident in the country where Zebracorp obtained such favourable court decision, it may prove next to impossible for Zebracorp to enforce the court decisions against the supplier. The local courts in the country of residence of the supplier may not be willing to recognise the validity of a court decision issued in a foreign country, which effectively renders Zebracorp\u2019s earlier court victory practically worthless.

The key for Zebracorp is that the definition is not overly restrictive, and does not thereby prevent Zebracorp from calling on retrofit where retrofit is clearly required to resolve the issue. In some instances an acceptable outcome can be found by using a dictionary definition of epidemic failure, and to define it as any design or manufacturing defect in the products that is systematic in nature and affects multiple products. Should this dictionary definition be seen as too broad by the supplier, we can narrow it down by stating that such defects need to adversely affect Zebracorp customer deliveries, or to have a material adverse effect on Zebracorp or its customers. The downside with this type of dictionary definitions, or any generic definitions, is that they also permit the supplier to challenge their applicability. However, they may be viable option in the event the parties are unable to find a more structured definition with clear numerical values/triggers.

Most vendors will seek to limit their liability for assistance and support in resolving the issue without assuming any firm financial liability other than by mutual agreement. Such limitations are rarely reasonable or acceptable. The fact is that Epidemic Failure clauses are commonplace in the industry and our end customers expect Zebracorp to be committed to implement certain corrective measures in the event of such a failure of epidemic nature at Zebracorp\u2019s cost. Zebracorp should at a minimum require the supplier/vendor of a product to be liable for A. the repair/replacement of all of the affected products; B. the de-installation and reinstallation work in the location/site where the products were used; and C. all associated transportation and logistics costs and expenses. Note that the liability of the supplier should specifically include all \u2018affected\u2019 products and not only all defective products.

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

The numbers can be adjusted depending on the nature of the products. Obviously the higher the percentage threshold, the less likely the Epidemic Failure clause can be used. It is often recommended to have more than one trigger. As an example we could agree, that a failure rate equal or above [XX] % during any given one-month period or a failure rate equal or above [XX] % during any given six-month period, will trigger an Epidemic Failure.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 136, "text": "Sophisticated vendors will prefer to insert a requirement that certain minimum number of units must found to be defective in order to trigger Epidemic Failure.

For example, if the trigger is 1%, but only 200 units were sold, then two defective units whose defect is attributable to the same root cause would constitute an Epidemic Failure because 1% of 200 is two.

If you need to change the proposed failure rate percentages in the templates, please check it with the relevant Product unit that is familiar with the product in question and understands the customer systems (Customer Support (technical support)). The key for Zebracorp is that the definition is not overly restrictive, and does not thereby prevent Zebracorp from calling on retrofit where retrofit is clearly required to resolve the issue. In some instances an acceptable outcome can be found by using a dictionary definition of epidemic failure, and to define it as any design or manufacturing defect in the products that is systematic in nature and affects multiple products. Should this dictionary definition be seen as too broad by the supplier, we can narrow it down by stating that such defects need to adversely affect Zebracorp customer deliveries, or to have a material adverse effect on Zebracorp or its customers. The downside with this type of dictionary definitions, or any generic definitions, is that they also permit the supplier to challenge their applicability. However, they may be viable option in the event the parties are unable to find a more structured definition with clear numerical values/triggers. Those triggers may also prove problematic as they may arbitrarily rule out the possibility of retrofit if these triggers are overly generous towards the suppliers.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 138, "text": "Remedies. Liabilities. In addition to the definition of the Epidemic Failure, another key consideration, when negotiating an Epidemic Failure clause, is the remedies available to Zebracorp when such failures do occur. Most vendors will seek to limit their liability for assistance and support in resolving the issue without assuming any firm financial liability other than by mutual agreement. Such limitations are rarely reasonable or acceptable. The fact is that Epidemic Failure clauses are commonplace in the industry and our end customers expect Zebracorp to be committed to implement certain corrective measures in the event of such a failure of epidemic nature at Zebracorp\u2019s cost. Zebracorp should at a minimum require the supplier/vendor of a product to be liable for A. the repair/replacement of all of the affected products; B. the de-installation and reinstallation work in the location/site where the products were used; and C. all associated transportation and logistics costs and expenses. Note that the liability of the supplier should specifically include all \u2018affected\u2019 products and not only all defective products.

Such events, while they may be unforeseeable and/or difficult to overcome, are no excuse for non-performance and should not qualify as Force Majeure. The supplier should be able to overcome these shortages by sourcing from multiple vendors or by maintaining buffer inventory of critical components.

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

An indemnity is essentially a contractual obligation resting on one party (Indemnitor) to make good a loss or damage incurred by another party (Indemnitee).  The indemnity provision allows the parties to agree on a set of costs and damages that must be reimbursed in the event certain facts or circumstances occur. In a standard action for breach of contract, the amount of money that may be recovered by the claimant is limited by various legal filters, such as a requirement that the damages must be foreseeable, unavoidable and reasonable. In the event the contract specifies that certain damages will be recoverable on an indemnity basis, then the level of damages will depend upon the drafting of the indemnity, and the damages need not necessarily be limited by the above referred filters. This is largely why indemnities are subjected to careful scrutiny during contract negotiations.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 272, "text": "The purpose of the Intellectual Property Rights indemnity provision is to make Zebracorp whole against any damages and costs Zebracorp may suffer as a result of the supplier\u2019s products/services infringing any third party intellectual property rights (IPR).", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 273, "text": "An IPR indemnity is a standard feature in any contract for the sale of hardware, or software license, or any a commissioned software or hardware development, or any IT consultancy services contract. This is chiefly due to the fact that intellectual property rights litigations are relatively commonplace in the IT/Telco industry. Hardware may easily infringe patents, or registered designs and even copyrights depending on the country/region. Also software frequently embodies methods of operation and may infringe both copyright and patents. With the large number of patents being applied for and granted, patent infringements claims in particular have become mundane within the IT industry. In contrast to copyright infringement where infringement customarily requires intentional or knowing copying of someone else\u2019s copyrighted material, patent infringement can occur without any culpable behaviour on the part of the infringer. Knowledge of the existing patent or an intention to infringe the patent is by and large irrelevant. In fact, it may admittedly be next to impossible for a vendor of sophisticated IT product to ensure that product does not infringe any third party patents anywhere in the world. It is therefore not unusual that IPR indemnity provisions are both time consuming and difficult to conclude.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 274, "text": "Scope of Indemnity.

Most vendors will seek to limit the obligation to compensate attorneys/legal fees to reasonable fees only. Whilst this may be seem a reasonable proposition, it should not be readily accepted. Attorneys/legal fees can be substantial, and having an obligation to prove that these fees are reasonable can materially impair our ability to seek compensation for such costs. Instead of agreeing to \u2018reasonable attorneys fees\u2019, we should consider countering with in e.g. \u2018necessarily incurred attorneys fees\u2019.

This qualifier changes the scope of the indemnity dramatically as it limits the indemnity solely to those damages that a court would order Zebracorp to pay to the third party claimant. Essentially the claim would not only have to be made by the third party claimant but subsequently litigated, and the judgment must be final before the vendor would incur any obligation to compensate us for the damages we have incurred. This leaves a substantial amount of damages and costs out of the indemnity and is only rarely acceptable. This is because most IP lawsuits hardly ever reach a point of final court order but are settled. Zebracorp is also likely to incur costs and damages as a result of in e.g. obtaining replacement products, experiencing production stoppages and order cancellations, customer claims and attorneys fees. If we do exceptionally agree to limit the indemnity to finally awarded damages we should specify that this final award can be either through arbitration or local court and that the supplier will also pay for any sums agreed in a settlement.  Also we should insert a provision to specify the supplier\u2019s obligations and liability in the event there is an injunction (i.e. a court order prohibiting ZEBRACORP or its customers from using or distributing the allegedly infringing products/services). Special attention should also be give to the ancillary obligations of the supplier (see section below) to make sure that the supplier has sufficient incentive to seek quick resolution by either providing a non-infringing replacing product and by obtaining a license from the third party claimant).

However, it is not recommended to delete the word \u201cindemnify\u201d and leave the term \u201chold harmless\u201d.

This is generally not acceptable as this type of a limitation would rule out the vendor\u2019s liability for any royalties that our end customer ends up paying to the third party claimant. It would also exclude the vendor\u2019s liability for any royalties that are calculated on a per use basis or calculated in e.g. by the revenues made by the end user.

As the (industry) customers of Zebracorp are typically the targets of the IPR infringement claim (and not us directly), and in quite many cases it is not a single component that is the solely infringing but rather certain system or a whole product used by the customer purchased from several vendors, it is unlikely that Zebracorp will in practice obtain full right to defend the case. This means that we should not offer the supplier unconditional and sole right and authority to defend the claims.

We should be careful when agreeing to accept this type of refund. In direct procurement contracts ZEBRACORP is likely to have sold and distributed the infringing products further to our end customers, and returning the products or requiring the end customer to cease further use of the product may cause irreparable damage and costs that far exceeds the potential royalties payable for the alleged infringement, or in worst case it may be impossible to comply with such request. Instead of agreeing to return the products or cease further use of the products, we should in such cases offer to agree to cease all further distribution and resale of the infringing products. When agreeing to this third option, we should also add language saying that this refund/right to cease further distribution of products is only available to the supplier in the event the two first options (i.e. the Design-Around and Substitution) are not reasonably feasible or achievable, and provided that we are given reasonable time to cease such further distribution.

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

A limitation of liability (LoL) clause permits contracting parties to reduce or eliminate the potential for indirect and consequential and such other special type of damages should there be a breach of contract. In some cases, a liability cap on damages may be used. The rationale behind liability limitations is to allocate the risk between the manufacturer, distributor and end user.  For example, a defective resistor or capacitor might cost less than a dollar, but could cause millions of dollars in loss revenues and such other indirect damages if the defective component causes a system outage. For obvious reasons, sophisticated vendors will spend a lot of time and effort negotiating these LoL clauses.  Absent an agreement explicitly limiting a seller\u2019s liability, a seller is liable for indirect and consequential damages (including loss of profits, loss of revenue, and other damages which can still be reasonably foreseeable).

You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

So the liability cap is really only relevant when facing a IPR infringement claim.

So the fact that the end customers has not enforced the LD provision against us, does not mean that Zebracorp would not have incurred any harm as result of the delay.

Such a liability can be hard to sell to a vendor, while Zebracorp will not be willing to forego the right either. The fact is that the vendor\u2019s eventual liability is often determined by individual circumstances, and much depends on how much the vendor in practice contributed to these customer penalties. So it will be difficult at best to agree what the vendor\u2019s liability should be for LDs paid by Zebracorp to its own customers. In most cases, our contracts remain silent about this, which is a perfectly acceptable compromise. Instead of having a provision that allows us to pass our endcustomer penalties over to our vendors, we can obtain the same back-to-back coverage by including penalty/LD provisions that are aligned with the penalty provisions of our respective customer contract.

This should be taken into account when assessing the financial impact. In project specific agreements we should be looking to have LDs at a level corresponding to the LDs required by our end customer so that the LD terms are back-to-back. Higher LD rates should apply in the event the supplier neglects to give us prior warning of the eventual delay. LDs should not be the supplier\u2019s sole liability but we should retain the right to seek direct damages in addition to the LDs, unless the LD\u2019s are high enough that they actually adequately cover the damage that Zebracorp is likely to incur.

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

In contrast, a nonmaterial breach is one which pertains to a minor or ancillary detail of the contract such as in e.g. occasional failures to meet the exact delivery times or quantities for certain product deliveries, which are not material to success of the project. The agreement may also specify what constitutes a material breach. In e.g. many standard license agreement templates used by software vendors will specify that any breach of the license grant or license terms will automatically mean that there has been a material breach of the agreement. However, we should be very careful when stating in the agreement what qualifies as material breach. Even the breach of license terms can be inadvertent and without any material impact to the licensor of the software (such as in e.g. making a single back-up copy of the software when the license terms did specifically allow making backup copies).

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

A warranty is a statement of fact made by the warrantor to the warrantee. Warranties often take the form of assurances from the seller as to the condition of the sold product or service. A product warranty is essentially a formal promise by a vendor that the product sold performs and/or has the qualities as the vendor has promised. Warranties are generally either express or implied. Express warranties are affirmative written promises about the quality and features of the products/services being sold that are specifically listed in the in the purchasing contract. For example, a battery will last 2 years under normal use.  In contract to express warranties, an implied warranty is derived from applicable legislation or trade usage and is made, regardless of whether or not it is specifically mentioned in the contract. Because of the uncertainty surrounding such implied warranties, any prudent supplier/subcontractor would want to limit its liability to the mutually in writing agreed express warranties only, and disclaim all liability for implied warranties.  Whilst ZEBRACORP procurement contract templates do not specifically exclude these type of implied warranties, focusing on express warranties only, and specifically excluding the applicability of implied warranties is generally an acceptable approach.  Please see more on exclusion of implied warranties in the sub-section titled \u2018Warranty Disclaimers\u2019 below.", "style": "Normal"}, {"index": 554, "text": "It is not unusual to see vendor templates to exclude all warranties from the outset.

These type of all-inclusive warranty disclaimers should be considered for free-ofcharge products and services only, and should never be considered when paying market price for a sold product/service. Only sample products (prototypes and preproduction units) are generally sold without a warranty, with the understanding that they will not be placed into commercial use and are provided free-of-charge.

ZEBRACORP does not control the design of the product and it would be unreasonable to pass the risk of design defects over to ZEBRACORP.

These qualifiers are very difficult to accept as it would put an obligation on Zebracorp to prove not only that there is a deviation but that the deviation is material. The seller could potentially use this qualifier to arbitrarily refuse warranty repairs/replacement requests. Also, having the seller warrant that the product it sells complies with its own product specifications is generally not viewed as an unreasonable request.

This is because in most of our end-customer contracts, the warranties start to run from provisional acceptance or date of delivery to customer sites. Note also that the warranty periods can vary greatly between different type of products.

However, please note that it is still customary to expect that the vendor pays for the logistics and other transportation costs associated with the delivery of the repaired or replaced equipment as part of its standard warranty obligations.

In case of refund, the seller may wish to limit the refund to a depreciated value of the product in the event the product cannot be repaired or replaced (e.g. if the product has a six year useful life and it fails after two years, the seller may want to limit the refund to 33% of the purchase price instead of 100%). Such depreciation provisions are not unusual. The numbers can always be negotiated. Sophisticated vendors will refuse to give Zebracorp an explicit right to require refund because of revenue recognition concerns.

Many vendors may also seek to disclaim software warranties altogether and instead say that the software comes on \u201cas is\u201d basis without any warranty of any kind.

In fact in many cases it may be adequate that the licensor warrants that the software is compliant with its specifications, and that the software materially performs all functions described in the product specifications/product documentation. In addition to these two warranted items, warranties on software being free from viruses, spyware or other malicious code is often non-contentions and we should seek to include such anti-virus warranty.

In these cases, it is important to have a warranty for software being free from errors and to have the licensor commit to resolve any errors within the resolution times that are specified in the support agreement. In order to make the warranty on error-free more palatable for the licensor, it may be worthwhile specifying that the software error correction measures are our sole remedy and the licensor\u2019s sole liability for failure to meet this type of a warranty.

--- CHUNK START ---
You are a legal document structure analyzer.
Your task is to classify text blocks from a contract into specific categories based on the document type.

**Input Format:**
You will receive a JSON list of blocks. Each block has an `index`, `text`, and optionally `style`.
Example: `[{"index": 0, "text": "1. DEFINITIONS", "style": "Heading 1"}, {"index": 1, "text": "In this agreement..."}]`

**Context Awareness:**
You may receive a `PREVIOUS CONTEXT` field. This tells you the state of the document immediately before the current chunk.
- If the previous chunk ended inside a section (e.g., "Table of Contents"), you MUST continue that section unless a clear new header appears.
- Do NOT start a new `CLAUSE_START` if the text is clearly a continuation of a list or table from the previous section.

**Style Rules:**
- If `style` contains "TOC", "Table of Contents", or "Index", classify it as `CONTENT` (or `INFO_START` if it's the main header).
- Do NOT classify TOC items as `CLAUSE_START`.

**Strict Rules:**
- **Annex vs Appendix**: Do NOT confuse them.
    - If the text says "Annex", use `ANNEX_START`.
    - If the text says "Appendix", use `APPENDIX_START`.
    - If the text says "Schedule", use `APPENDIX_START` (unless specifically instructed otherwise, but usually Schedule = Appendix).
- **Plural Headers**: Generic plural headers like "APPENDICES", "SCHEDULES", or "EXHIBITS" (without a specific letter/number) are `INFO_START`. Do NOT tag them as `APPENDIX_START`.
- **Table Continuity**:
    - If you are inside a section (e.g., Annex) and see text that looks like a table row (e.g., "| Col 1 | Col 2 |"), tag it as `CONTENT`.
    - **Ignore Repeated Headers**: If you see headers like "Table continued", "Page X", or repeated column names inside a table, tag them as `CONTENT`. Do NOT start a new section.

**Output Format:**
Return a JSON list of objects. Each object must have:
- `index`: The EXACT integer index from the input block.
- `type`: The classification tag.

Example: `[{"index": 0, "type": "INFO"}, {"index": 1, "type": "CLAUSE"}]`

**Allowed Tags & Rules:**

If Document Type is **MASTER** or **SUBORDINATE**:
**Goal:** Group the document into high-level sections. Do NOT split sub-sections.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-contractual section.
    -   Examples: Preamble, Recitals, Table of Contents, Party Details, Signature Pages.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the first block (header/title) of this section.

2.  `CLAUSE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a main contractual clause.
    -   Examples: "1. DEFINITIONS", "2. TERM", "ARTICLE 3: FEES".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the main header (e.g. "1.", "Article I"). Do NOT tag sub-headers (e.g. "1.1") with this.

3.  `APPENDIX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Appendix.
    -   Examples: "APPENDIX A", "APPENDIX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

4.  `ANNEX_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Annex.
    -   Examples: "ANNEX A", "ANNEX 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

5.  `EXHIBIT_START`: Use this for the **START** of an Exhibit.
    -   Examples: "EXHIBIT A", "EXHIBIT 1".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

6.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, sub-clauses (1.1, 1.1.1), list items, and content following a header.
    -   This content will be grouped under the preceding `_START` tag.

If Document Type is **REFERENCE**:
**Goal:** Identify Guidelines.

**Allowed Tags:**

1.  `INFO_START`: Use this for the **START** of a non-guideline section.
    -   Examples: Title, Introduction, Scope.
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

2.  `GUIDELINE_START`: Use this for the **START** of a Guideline section.
    -   Examples: "Guideline 1", "Policy A", "Standard 1.2".
    -   Rule: Tag ONLY the header.

3.  `CONTENT`: Use this for **EVERYTHING ELSE**.
    -   Body text, list items, and content following a header.

**Prohibited Tags for REFERENCE:**
-   Do NOT use `CLAUSE_START`, `APPENDIX_START`, `ANNEX_START`, or `EXHIBIT_START`.

**Critical Instructions:**
1.  **Preserve Indices**: Return a classification for EVERY block.
2.  **No IDs**: Do NOT generate `id` fields.
3.  **One Section = One Start Tag**: Do not fragment a section. For example, "1. Definitions" gets `CLAUSE_START`. "1.1" gets `CONTENT`. "1.2" gets `CONTENT`. This keeps them all in one "Clause 1" block.
4.  **Appendices**: "APPENDIX A" gets `APPENDIX_START`. All text inside it gets `CONTENT`.
5.  **Ignore References**: Do NOT use `_START` tags for mentions in a Table of Contents. Use `CONTENT` or `INFO_START` (if it's the TOC header).

Many other countries have Commercial Codes that provide comprehensive statutory warranties that will apply unless the parties have agreed otherwise in their respective contract. Excluding these implied and statutory warranties is generally acceptable for Zebracorp. This is because we will be relying exclusively on the warranties that we stipulated in our contract. Also the remedies, that is, the rights of the buyer to in e.g. a refund or a replacement product when a warranty is breached are often exclusively defined in the purchasing contract. In these cases, it is not problematic to accept the above type of language that specifically says that all remedies are exclusively defined in the contract.", "style": "Normal"}]
