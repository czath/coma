It's crucial for corporate restructuring (M&A, reorganizations) to avoid deal complications, delays, and potential extortion from counterparties. This objective is concretely implemented by allowing Zebracorp to unconditionally assign, novate, delegate, or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations, in whole, in part, or through a splitting of the agreement, to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line without prior supplier consent.

For the 'general rule' group, Agents 1, 5, 7 classified a partial text as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 3 classified a more complete text (including justification) as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). \n\nEvaluation: The introductory paragraph (Candidates 2, 4, 6) is purely descriptive context and does not represent an actionable rule, definition, or specific tactic. While informative, it is not a primary 'finding' in the sense of a contractual obligation or definition. Therefore, it is not included in the Golden Record.\n\nFor the 'general rule' (Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7), the most comprehensive verbatim text is from Candidate 3, which includes the rule, its justification, and a condition. The first sentence of this text clearly establishes an expectation/obligation, making it a 'GUIDELINE'. The subsequent sentences provide crucial context and rationale, which are best captured in the `justification` and `conditions` fields of a GUIDELINE type. Therefore, the primary classification is GUIDELINE.\n\nValue Assessment: The selected verbatim text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides a critical rule for liability allocation. It passes the 'So What?' test as it defines a core business risk allocation.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it is actionable, creating a clear expectation for vendors. It is complete, capturing all relevant parts of the paragraph. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given it's explicitly stated as a 'general rule' and dictates a fundamental aspect of vendor liability.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiation, clarifies risk allocation, and protects Zebracorp's interests. It is a valuable item to keep.",

The second (Candidates 2, 5, 7, 9) describes the characteristics of Zebracorp's standard definition, with agents split between GUIDELINE, DEFINITION, and OTHER (INFO). \n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: Both ideas are clear, self-sufficient, and provide valuable strategic and informational context. The first statement ('Zebracorp prefers a broad definition...') represents a primary strategic stance, while the second ('The Zebracorp standard definition... already narrows...') clarifies the inherent scope of that preferred definition. Given the instruction to consolidate into a single Golden Record, the primary strategic preference is chosen as the core, with the clarifying information integrated into the 'expert_insight' and 'source_insight' fields.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The chosen verbatim expresses a 'preference' and 'encompasses' certain information, which is best classified as 'OTHER' with a 'TACTIC' subtype, as it outlines Zebracorp's strategic approach to defining confidential information in negotiations. It is not a direct definition of 'confidential information' itself, nor is it a direct actionable obligation (GUIDELINE) but rather a strategic position. The 'plain_text' accurately rephrases the chosen verbatim. The 'expert_insight' and 'source_insight' effectively integrate the clarifying context from the second set of candidates, explaining that this 'broad' definition still includes common exclusions.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This record is highly useful for understanding Zebracorp's negotiation strategy regarding confidentiality definitions, helping to protect company information and guide negotiators.",
