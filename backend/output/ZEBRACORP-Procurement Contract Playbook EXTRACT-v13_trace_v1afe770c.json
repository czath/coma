The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party\u2019s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open. An acquisition or a merger would in most countries serve to \"vest\" all assets and liabilities including contracts automatically to a merging and surviving entity or the acquiring party, as the case may be, by \u2018operation of law\u2019 without a need to obtain a consent from the opposing party.",

Agents 1, 5, 7 classified a shorter version of this as 'GUIDELINE', while Agent 3 classified a longer version (including justification) as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). \n\nDECISION: The core of the finding is Zebracorp's expectation and obligation placed on the supplier, making it a 'GUIDELINE'. The longer verbatim from Candidate 3 was chosen as the definitive 'verbatim_text' because it fully captures both the rule and its explicit justification, providing complete context. The introductory 'OTHER' (INFO) findings were deemed less critical as standalone actionable items and primarily serve as background for this core guideline, thus rejected to adhere to the 'single Golden Record' output requirement.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The `plain_text` was rewritten to ensure self-sufficiency by clarifying the 'such costs' reference, drawing context from the preceding paragraph in the source text. The guideline is clear, actionable, and crucial for understanding risk allocation.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: As a GUIDELINE, it creates a specific obligation for suppliers to bear certain costs and meet demand. It is complete and classified as 'CRITICAL' due to its fundamental impact on financial risk management.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiation by establishing Zebracorp's default position, and protects the company by shifting risk to the supplier.
