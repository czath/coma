The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.

For the general rule, Agents 1, 5, and 7 correctly identified it as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 2 classified it as OTHER/INFO. Agent 4 also classified it as GUIDELINE but included more context. The longer verbatim text (from Candidates 3 and 5) provides a more complete and self-sufficient statement of the rule, including its justification.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The selected GUIDELINE text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides both the core expectation and its underlying rationale. It does not contain dangling references.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The statement 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes a specific obligation and risk allocation for vendors, making it a GUIDELINE. It is not generic advice. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given its role as the default position for liability.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This finding is highly specific and actionable, directly informing Zebracorp's default stance on component/materials liability. It is crucial for negotiating supplier agreements and managing financial risk. While the introductory context (OTHER/INFO) was also valuable, the prompt requires a single Golden Record. The GUIDELINE represents the primary, actionable legal finding derived from this cluster, making it the most salient record for a legal analysis system. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is chosen as the Golden Record, and the contextual information is implicitly covered by the 'justification' and 'expert_insight' fields.",
