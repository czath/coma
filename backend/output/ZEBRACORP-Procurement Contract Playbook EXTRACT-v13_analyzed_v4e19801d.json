The `plain_text` and `expert_insight` have been crafted to make this implicit guideline explicit and self-sufficient, passing the Value Assessment. The finding is actionable, creating an obligation for Zebracorp to define acceptance periods to mitigate legal uncertainty and unintended deemed acceptance.

'Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests.' (Candidates 1, 4, 6) - All agents classified this as a GUIDELINE (HIGH).\n2.  'The completion of acceptance should be subject to the successful completion of acceptance tests that are performed by either Zebracorp or our end customers, or, as applicable, both jointly.' (Candidates 2, 3, 5, 7) - Agents were split between GUIDELINE (3 agents) and OTHER (1 agent). \n\nTYPE RESOLUTION: For the second finding, the phrase 'should be subject to' within a section explicitly titled 'Zebracorp Preferred Position' indicates a desired contractual obligation or rule. Therefore, classifying it as a `GUIDELINE` is appropriate, as it defines a specific condition for acceptance that Zebracorp aims to implement in its contracts. The classification of `CRITICAL` is supported by its inclusion in the 'Preferred Position' section and its fundamental nature in controlling the acceptance process.\n\nSELECTION JUSTIFICATION: Given the instruction to produce a *single* Golden Record, and the presence of two distinct rules within the cluster, a choice must be made. The second finding, which states Zebracorp's preferred position on *how* acceptance is determined (i.e., subject to tests performed by Zebracorp or its customers), is a more foundational and strategic guideline. It dictates a core control mechanism for Zebracorp's quality assurance and risk mitigation. The first finding, while important, describes a typical procedural outcome (issuing a certificate) *after* acceptance criteria are met, making it a secondary detail compared to the conditions for acceptance itself. Therefore, the second finding is selected as the primary Golden Record for this cluster due to its strategic importance and explicit mention as a 'Zebracorp Preferred Position'.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT & UTILITY CHECK: The selected finding is clear, self-sufficient, and actionable. It creates a specific condition for acceptance, directly impacting contractual terms and protecting Zebracorp's interests by ensuring control over the verification process. It helps a human negotiate better by highlighting a critical non-negotiable or highly preferred stance.",

This is generally acceptable only in cases where Zebracorp is purchasing customized products or other non-standard products which the supplier is unable to sell to any third parties.') provides the necessary context for the pronoun 'This', making the statement self-sufficient and clear.

This functions as a clear rule or restriction on Zebracorp's actions and decision-making, making `GUIDELINE` the most appropriate classification. It is highly actionable and specific, not generic advice. The classification as `CRITICAL` is justified due to its direct impact on Zebracorp's financial exposure.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is crucial for understanding and negotiating Zebracorp's liability, providing a clear boundary for when such liability may be considered.
