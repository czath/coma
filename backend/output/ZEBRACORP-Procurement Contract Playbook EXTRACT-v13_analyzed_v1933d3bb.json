It mandates that the Procurement Contract Playbook is company confidential, strictly for internal Zebracorp use, and explicitly prohibits its distribution outside the company.

The directive is clear, self-sufficient, and creates an actionable obligation for Zebracorp employees. It passed the Value and Utility tests. The type has been standardized to 'GUIDELINE' as it represents a mandatory rule of conduct, rather than 'OTHER' (Instruction), which is typically used for less formal or less critical directives.

Value Assessment: Both identified statements are clear, self-sufficient, and provide valuable information about the playbook's scope and utility. Type-Specific Criteria: Both are accurate descriptions of the playbook's content, not rules or definitions of specific contractual terms. Utility Check: Both are useful for understanding the playbook's purpose and how to leverage its content. Consolidation Decision: Due to the strict requirement for 'verbatim_text' to be exact and represent a single, contiguous segment, these two distinct sentences cannot be combined into a single 'decision_content' object. I have selected the finding related to 'explanations on the implications of certain key legal terms' as the primary Golden Record because understanding implications is more directly aligned with the playbook's stated purpose of providing 'guidance on negotiating procurement contracts'. The other finding, while valid, describes a more foundational glossary-like function. The 'plain_text', 'expert_insight', 'justification', 'implication_company', and 'source_insight' fields have been consolidated from the best aspects of the contributing agents for the selected finding.",

In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.

This is a rule, not merely a tactic or advice, hence 'GUIDELINE' is the correct classification. All agents classified it as 'CRITICAL' when identified as a GUIDELINE.\nValue Assessment: The verbatim text is clear and self-sufficient. The plain_text is refined for optimal clarity. Crucial context from the broader source text, indicating that this rule applies 'When Zebracorp agrees to take component liability', has been explicitly added to the 'conditions' field to ensure self-sufficiency and completeness.\nType-Specific Criteria (GUIDELINE): The finding is highly actionable, creating a specific obligation for the supplier and a clear consequence for failure. It is complete and correctly classified as 'CRITICAL' due to its direct impact on financial liability and risk management.\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific, directly impacts contractual rights and obligations, helps Zebracorp manage financial exposure, and provides clarity for both parties, making it a valuable finding.",

Evaluation: The first sentence, 'Zebracorp\u2019s liability has an overall maximum ceiling, expressed both as a fixed dollar amount, and as percentage of the sales price (which should exclude taxes) of each product,' is a definitive statement of a contractual obligation or limitation. It sets a specific restriction on Zebracorp's liability and how it must be structured. The subsequent 'Ideally' clause is a recommendation or negotiation tactic, distinct from the firm rule. Therefore, the core statement is correctly classified as a GUIDELINE. It passes the Clarity & Context test as it is self-sufficient. It passes the Actionability and Completeness tests as it creates a specific, quantifiable obligation. It passes the Utility Check as it is critical for financial risk management.
