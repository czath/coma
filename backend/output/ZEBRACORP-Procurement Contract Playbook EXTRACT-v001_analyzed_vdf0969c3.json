      "text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe purpose of this Procurement Contract Playbook is to provide additional guidance on negotiating procurement contracts and Zebracorp\u2019s preferred negotiating positions on certain key legal terms in such contracts. The focus is on providing the essentials on negotiating these terms, and some drafting points. This Playbook also seeks to give explanations on the implications of certain key legal terms. There is less focus on laying out Zebracorp preferred position on these terms since the preferred terms are typically well reflected in the provisions of the corresponding Zebracorp procurement contract templates. The playbook also contains explanations on certain commonly used legal terms and concepts.\nPlease note that this document is company confidential and for Zebracorp internal use only.

      "text": "ACCEPTANCE\nGeneral. The purpose of acceptance provisions is to enable the seller to demonstrate that deliverables sold by the seller meet the mutually agreed requirements, and for the buyer to be able to verify that such deliverables do comply with such requirements. An acceptance in regard to its extent and effect, may be either final, conditional, or partial. Common terms used in subcontracts include: PAC = Partial or Provisional Acceptance Certificate; and FAC = Final Acceptance Certificate.\nAcceptance provisions should always be drafted and reviewed with special care. Acceptance provisions are essential since they ultimately define whether the works rendered by the subcontractor meet the mutually agreed requirements, and when these works have been completed enabling the supplier/subcontractor to recognize revenue. Acceptance generally triggers the right for the subcontractor to invoice and get paid for its deliverables and it can stop the liquidated damages clock. Moreover, the majority of contracts stipulate that the warranty starts to run from the date of acceptance. In cases where the subcontractor is working directly for Zebracorp in a particular customer project, the acceptance provisions would need to be aligned with the corresponding provisions of our customer contract in order to ensure that acceptance is not granted to the subcontractor before securing acceptance from the end customer.\nAcceptance provisions are likely to have less relevance in those global sourcing contracts where the supplier is not delivering directly anything to Zebracorp\u2019s customers and where the supplier payments are not tied to acceptance but where payments are triggered in e.g. by the delivery of materials or products to Zebracorp global hubs. Zebracorp uses these type of contracts with practically all of its component suppliers and the majority of its global OEM vendors. In such contracts acceptance provisions may be omitted and the practical aspect of product acceptance can be dealt with the warranty provisions as long as Zebracorp\u2019s payment obligations are not tied to acceptance.\nWhenever the deliverables purchased by Zebracorp are subject to acceptance, we should focus on the description of acceptance procedures and the contractual acceptance criteria.\nAcceptance Procedure. The subcontractor/supplier should inform Zebracorp when the results of works or other deliverables are ready for acceptance i.e. for acceptance tests and verification. This acceptance test period is usually limited to a certain number of weeks following receipt of the product. The range of acceptance periods usually varies between 20-60 days, with the majority of contracts having a 30-day period. System level testing may require longer testing period. Absent a contractually agreed acceptance period, acceptance may be governed by applicable laws. In e. g. section 2-606 of the United States Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d) provides that acceptance is deemed to occur when the buyer fails to reject the goods within a \u201creasonable time\u201d.\nIn most cases the supplier/subcontractor should be allowed to participate in the site level acceptance tests. System level testing is usually completed without supplier\u2019s involvement. Whenever Zebracorp allows the supplier to participate in the testing, the supplier should never be in control of the acceptance tests. Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests. The acceptance procedure may define a two-step acceptance in the form of provisional acceptance followed up by final acceptance. Provisional acceptance is often granted at the point in time when the deliverables substantially meet the agreed acceptance criteria. Final acceptance will be granted subsequently once all errors and deficiencies identified during the provisional acceptance tests have been remedied and the end customer has accepted the product.\nThe acceptance may be based on certain system elements only or may include a cluster of elements up to entire system acceptance. It is often in the interest of the selling party to limit the scope of the acceptance to a system element based acceptance since this will enable the selling party to start invoicing before the entire system is accepted. Zebracorp can agree to system element based or other partial acceptance only so long as this is in line with the corresponding acceptance provisions of our customer contract.\nNote also that in the majority of cases we may be able to agree to acceptance being deemed to take place without us issuing a formal acceptance certificate when the a certain time period for completing the acceptance tests has passed (\u201cbackstop date\u201d), or when we or our customers takes the results of the works into commercial or production use (\u201cdeemed acceptance\u201d).  It is however recommended to verify that such deemed acceptance or backstop dates are also agreed in our corresponding customer contract (if applicable) to make sure the acceptance provisions are back-to-back. It is also worth checking with the respective project manager that Zebracorp has sufficient time to complete system level testing before any deemed acceptance is being triggered. When agreeing on a backstop date for completing the acceptance test, we should ensure that acceptance is not triggered, if the delay in completing the acceptance tests is not caused by reasons solely attributable to ZEBRACORP. Any deficiencies, errors or deviations found in the subcontractor\u2019s performance should automatically result in an extension of time for completing the acceptance tests. Also it is always recommended to have the subcontractor agree to send a final formal written notice to us and agree to give us a reasonable cure period before granting deemed acceptance.  This will avoid us granting acceptance inadvertently for something that has not been properly tested. Most vendors will readily agree to an obligation to send such additional written reminder.\nSome of Zebracorp\u2019s customer contracts will specifically allow the end customer to commercially use the deliverables for a certain period before granting final acceptance. This period of time may be called in e.g. Product or System Performance Evaluation Period. Whenever Zebracorp has agreed to such evaluation period, it is important to have our respective subcontractors for that particular customer agree to similar commercial evaluation period before granting Final Acceptance.\nAcceptance Criteria. Having clear acceptance criteria in the contract will benefit both parties. The required functionality and performance criteria can be described in a separate document which is attached to the agreement. Suppliers are in many cases reluctant to accept general phrases found in some of our procurement contract templates that tie acceptance to in e.g. works being completed \u201cto the reasonable satisfaction of the [Purchaser]\u201d. Such subjective or unilateral criteria can, with the assistance of Zebracorp product line or customer team, be replaced by objective and clearly defined acceptance criteria. In fact, this approach would be preferred over agreeing to language where we merely state that acceptance test will be passed when the deliverables \u2018substantially conform\u2019 or \u201cmaterially comply\u201d with the agreed specifications. Such ambiguous language is often prone to disputes.\nIn some instances we can agree that minor deficiencies/errors found during the acceptance tests that do not prevent the intended use of the results of the works will not prevent acceptance, but will be remedied by the subcontractor as part of its warranty obligations or within a certain mutually agreed timeframe. Again, in those subcontracts where the supplier is delivering the deliverables directly to Zebracorp\u2019s customer, it is naturally important that the acceptance is sufficiently aligned with Zebracorp\u2019s customer acceptance.\nZebracorp Preferred Position. The completion of acceptance should be subject to the successful completion of acceptance tests that are performed by either Zebracorp or our end customers, or, as applicable, both jointly. The supplier/subcontractor participation to the acceptance tests will be at the discretion of Zebracorp and our end customer, as applicable. The agreement should provide Zebracorp sufficient time to complete the acceptance tests. Failure to complete the tests in a timely manner should not automatically lead to deemed acceptance, but the supplier/subcontractor should first be required to notify Zebracorp in writing and request Zebracorp to complete the acceptance within a reasonable time frame. Acceptance should be either final, partial or conditional as indicated by Zebracorp. Below is an example of an acceptance procedure provision which reflects Zebracorp preferred position.\n\u201cThe [Supplier] shall notify Zebracorp in writing when the [Supplier] considers that the [Works] or the relevant milestone has been completed in accordance with this [Agreement], and request [Zebracorp] to initiate the acceptance tests. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written notice [Zebracorp] shall, if satisfied that the [Works] or the relevant milestone has been duly completed and the agreed acceptance criteria is met, issue a certificate of acceptance for the milestone in question. Such acceptance can be partial or conditional as indicated in [Zebracorp\u2019] acceptance certificate.\nIn the event that [Zebracorp] is not satisfied that the [Works] and/or the relevant milestone has been completed or if the agreed acceptance criteria or other agreed requirements are not met, [Zebracorp] shall notify [Supplier] thereof within the aforementioned time limit and, at the request of the [Supplier], provide the reasons for refusing the acceptance.\nThe [Supplier] shall promptly remedy any failures or deficiencies in meeting the acceptance criteria set out below and/or such other agreed requirements, and also rectify and remedy any and all defects and deficiencies identified by [Zebracorp] and/or [Zebracorp\u2019s] customer during the acceptance tests and inform [Zebracorp] in writing upon completing such remedial action. [Zebracorp] will issue the certificate of acceptance only after having satisfied itself that such deficiencies and defects have been duly remedied and rectified, and the [Works] or the relevant part thereof has been completed and all of the requirements for issuing the certificate of acceptance in this [Agreement] have been met.\u201d\nThe acceptance criteria and acceptance procedures should always be aligned with the end customer acceptance provisions in any such subcontracts that are specifically made for a particular end customer project."

      "text": "ASSIGNMENT\nGeneral. An assignment clause determines whether the rights, obligations and duties under a particular contract may be transferred in whole or in part to another third party, and under what conditions. Assignment clauses can become critical in a sale of business, acquisition or other similar transaction. Having an obligation to obtain consents for assigning contracts from present contract parties can complicate and potentially sidetrack the contemplated transaction. Failure to pay close attention to the language of the assignment clause while the contract is being negotiated may also create an opportunity for the nontransferring party to later extort concessions in return to its consent to the contract assignment.\nIt is for these reasons important to make sure that each contract we conclude gives us the maximum flexibility to assign without the supplier\u2019s consent to any succeeding entity to Zebracorp (in case of a reorganization), or at the minimum allow free assignment by Zebracorp to an affiliate (which accomplishes the same ability for re-organization if Zebracorp is acquired through a share purchase at the shareholder level).\nIn the event the supplier/subcontractor refuses to grant us right to assign to an affiliate, then we should at the very minimum have a note saying that the approval for the assignment will not be \u201carbitrarily or unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed\u201d.\nOur right to assign each contract should include also partial assignment of the contract. In many cases such partial assignment right is implicit from the right to assign the entire agreement, but it would be recommended to expressly agree on a right to assign the agreement either in its entirety or partially. Ideally we should also seek to secure a right to \u2018split\u2019 the respective contract, in case of divestment of a Zebracorp business line so that both Zebracorp and any third party acquirer of any specific Zebracorp business line will continue to be able to use the same contract.\nPlease note that, when negotiating the assignment clause with our suppliers/subcontractors, we would not wish to agree to a mutual assignment right. This means that in most cases we would rather forego our right to assign than to agree on any language that would allow the supplier/subcontractor to freely assign the agreement to a third party without our consent. This is because each of our suppliers have gone through a selection process where each supplier has been deemed financially and otherwise able to meet their eventual contractual commitments towards Zebracorp. Allowing the supplier to freely substitute itself to another third party would negate the entire selection process, and in worst case enable the supplier to effectively walk away from critical contractual commitments.\nAlso note that our right to assign the contract should not be made subject to us remaining jointly liable for the assigned contract together with the assignee. The assignment should be unconditional in the sense that Zebracorp will not accept liability for\nany commitments made by any third party assignee. The assignment should also provide a clean exit for Zebracorp in the sense that Zebracorp will not remain jointly liable under the assigned agreement with the new contracting party.\nAssignment by Operation of Law.  When planning acquisitions or such other corporate transactions, the acquiring party will usually have to consider how it prefers to structure the transactions. The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party\u2019s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open.\nAn acquisition or a merger would in most countries serve to \"vest\" all assets and liabilities including contracts automatically to a merging and surviving entity or the acquiring party, as the case may be, by \u2018operation of law\u2019 without a need to obtain a consent from the opposing party. The parties are of course free to agree between themselves that a ownership change of certain magnitude (in e.g. affecting over 50 % of all outstanding shares) will require the other party\u2019s consent.\nAlso, clauses that prohibit any transfer by any kind of merger or \"change of control\" are not uncommon. Below is an example of such clause:\n\u201cAny attempted assignment of this [Agreement] whether directly, by change in control or by operation of law, shall be ineffective unless effected with the other party\u2019s prior written consent\u201d.\nVariants of the above provision can be found in particular in suppliers\u2019 own contract templates.\nZebracorp also has such ownership clauses in some of its supplier contracts, most notably in the R&D related contracts where the identity of the party doing development work can be an important factor. While we may want to restrict the supplier from changing ownership or control without our approval, Zebracorp is often not itself willing to agree to such restrictions.\nZebracorp\u2019s firm view is that assignment of contract by operation of law should not require the supplier\u2019s consent, and in most cases we should reject any language that requires us to seek consent from other party in connection with transfer of agreement by operation of law. This is largely due to the fact that these type of provisions are likely to cause complications when planning mergers, acquisitions or such other transactions. For example, if Zebracorp was planning on forming a merger with another company, we would work from the assumption that our contracts with our suppliers/subcontractors would be automatically transferred to the new merged entity by operation of law without the need seek consents from our supplier base. An assignment restriction described above is likely to impact the timing, cost and our ability to consummate a \"smooth\" merger or such other transaction. In those critical R&D contracts and the like where we do impose these very same assignment restrictions on our suppliers, it would be better to abandon the entire clause than to agree to mutual clause that would restrict Zebracorp from assigning the contract. The fact that Zebracorp is not willing to make these assignment provisions mutual can often be explained to the supplier by the asymmetric contractual relationship i.e. that of the customer and the supplier.  In most cases, we can make the contract more palatable to the supplier by agreeing to allow the supplier transfer the contract by operation of law to any party that is not a direct competitor of Zebracorp.\nAssignment vs. Novation. Under UK laws, an assignment of rights under a contract is normally restricted solely to the benefits of the contract. Where a party wishes to transfer both the benefit and burden of the contract without any residual liability (as is usually the case), the assignment of the contract would generally needs to be done by way of a novation. For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Please speak to a member of the Legal & Compliance team to obtain the appropriate templates/language. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment. This in itself is not issue in the majority of cases, as most jurisdictions will recognize the term novation to mean the same as transfer of a contract.\nChanges of Company Name. Companies have the freedom to change the trade name that they use to conduct their business. When changing the name of the company, the registered legal entity which can be identified through each company\u2019s individual registration number remains the same. These type of changes in the name or registered addresses of a company are not regarded as assignments so long as the underlying legal entity remains the same and only the name/address of the company changes. Accordingly, there is no need to seek or grant consent to such change of name/registered address alone.  A unilateral notification of the name change to the other contracting party should be sufficient. While it is recommended to clarify the name change in future contract amendments, strictly speaking this is not necessary. The name change can be mentioned in a contract amendment in e.g. by adding a following note in brackets after the name of the contracting party:  e.g. \u201c(formerly known as Zebracorp Space)\u201d or, in short, \u201c(f/k/a Zebracorp Space)\u201d.\nZebracorp Preferred Position. ZEBRACORP\u2019s preferred position as regards to assignment provisions is largely explained above. An example of our preferred assignment clause is below:\n\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this [Agreement], neither party may assign, novate, delegate, or transfer this [Agreement], or any of its individual rights or obligations under this [Agreement], without the prior written approval of the other Party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Any attempted assignment, novation, delegation, or transfer without the necessary approval is void.  However, [Zebracorp] may, without the prior written consent of the [Supplier], unconditionally assign, novate, delegate or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations under this [Agreement], in whole, in part, or through a splitting of the [Agreement], to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line to which this contract relates. As of the effective date of the assignment, novation, delegation, or transfer, the assignee entity(ies) assumes all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the [Agreement], and [Zebracorp] is unconditionally released and discharged from all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the [Agreement].  [Supplier] will work cooperatively with [Zebracorp] and the assignee entity(ies) to ensure a smooth and orderly transition.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018BEST EFFORTS\u2019 PROVISIONS\nContract provisions that use the phrase \u2018best efforts\u2019 or one of its variants are often a source of confusion when negotiating agreements. Widely used variants to the phrase include \u2018commercially reasonable efforts\u2019, \u2018commercially reasonable best efforts\u2019, \u2018good-faith efforts, \u2018all reasonable efforts\u2019 where the term \u2018efforts\u2019 is often replaced with the term \u2018endeavours\u2019. In each case the intent of the phrase is to remove the absolute duty or commitment to accomplish certain specific obligation or target. Understandably these phrases are often introduced by vendors in an attempt to soften their liability to meet some of the obligations that a purchasing agreement imposes on such vendors. As an example a product vendor may wish rephrase an obligation to meet Zebracorp quality requirements and standards to an obligation to make merely commercially reasonable efforts to meet such quality requirements and standards.\nThe legal meaning of these phrases varies from country to country. As an example under NY USA laws the phrase \u2018best efforts\u2019 basically only puts a good faith obligation on party do try to meet the prescribed obligation. Failure to accomplish such best efforts obligation would generally not be a breach of contract. This is because these phrases are considered too vague to create a binding enforceable obligation. This is in stark contrast to some of the common law countries where these phrases have more binding nature. The view generally held by many US lawyers is that party promising to do \u2018best efforts\u2019 is required to do everything in its power to accomplish the target even if it bankrupts itself in the process. You should therefore expect in particular US based vendors to replace \u2018best efforts\u2019 with less onerous efforts standards such as in e.g. \u2018commercial reasonable efforts\u2019. As a rule of thumb we should be able to accept these less stringent variants whenever we would have been willing to accept the phrase \u2018best efforts\u2019.\nIn all cases it is important to keep in mind that the phrase \u2018best efforts\u2019 together with all its variants are ultimately very vague and do not provide a firm commitment to meet the agreed requirement or obligation. Hence, we should, despite their prevalence, be careful in accepting such phrases. As an example, when a supplier is hesitant as to whether it can comply with in e.g. all of the Zebracorp quality requirements or Zebracorp environmental requirements, it would be recommend to ask the supplier to identify which specific requirements the supplier is unable to meet and revise those as needed, instead of simply saying that the supplier will use best efforts or commercially reasonable effort to meet such requirements. The odds are that the supplier has no issues in committing itself to the majority of the requirements but only has reservations on some of the requirements. By requiring the supplier to identify those requirements that the supplier is unable to comply with, we often receive valuable information on the technical and other capabilities of the supplier products/solutions - information which would be lost if we merely accept the \u2018best effort\u2019 qualifier.\nIn the event the supplier/subcontractor does insist on using the phrase \u2018commercially reasonable efforts\u2019 in the context of obligations that should by their nature be fulfilled with a certain degree of firm commitment, a compromise can sometimes be found by specifying what the parties mean by this phrase. This can be done in e.g. by adding: \u201cFor the purposes hereof the term \u2018commercially reasonable efforts\u2019 means, with respect to a given goal, the efforts that a professional and diligent company would use and undertake so as to achieve that goal as expeditiously as possible and excludes any action or expenditure that would be unreasonably disproportionate or burdensome to achieve such goal\u201d. The language of this type of a definition can obviously be negotiated so that the parties have a mutually acceptable understanding and agreement as to what is the required level of commitment."

      "text": "COMPONENT/MATERIALS LIABILITY\nOccasionally, our vendors are required to incur costs and liability (e.g., order components and materials) before they receive a firm order. A vendor may also need to take such action upon receipt of our order and the order can later be cancelled. Vendors may also build up stocks in anticipation of our orders based on the forecasts that Zebracorp has issued for the vendor. In each case, the vendor may incur costs that are not recoverable if the expected business fails to materialize.\nAs a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs and to be able to fully meet the occasional order cancellation and to meet our forecasted demand (as well as some additional drop-in orders as set forth in the flexibility parameters). The risk that the forecast or estimated demand does not materialize is typically the selling party\u2019s business risk and this also applies to Zebracorp in our sales towards our end customers. In cases where the vendor has many customers for its product, the vendor should have no great issues with assuming such risk.\nFrom time to time, Zebracorp may nevertheless need to consider accepting certain liability for the components or other materials used to manufacture products. This is generally acceptable only in cases where Zebracorp is purchasing customized products or other non-standard products which the supplier is unable to sell to any third parties. When agreeing to take such component liability it is important to consider that:\nZebracorp\u2019s liability is limited to certain customized products only that cannot in any manner be used or exploited by the supplier in its other businesses.\nSupplier has an affirmative obligation to mitigate its costs and damages by way of in e.g. immediately ceasing the production upon learning that Zebracorp will not consume the products, or by returning any components and materials to their respective third party vendors if permitted.\nZebracorp\u2019s liability is limited in time in e.g. to products forecasted in its most recent forecast.\nSupplier should also have an obligation to report ZEBRACORP\u2019s then-current material/component liability on regular intervals in order to avoid any unforeseen surprises.\nZebracorp has an option to require the supplier to maintain the products in storage against payment of a mutually agreed reasonable carrying charge.\nZebracorp obtains the title to the materials/components paid by it, or an option to request the supplier to dispose the unused materials/components without additional cost.\nZebracorp\u2019s is relieved from all liability in cases where failure to consume the products is not caused solely by Zebracorp (but in e.g. the supplier by having quality or delivery issues).\nSupplier has an a short time frame to present its claims, failing which the supplier foregoes its right to claim compensation.\nZebracorp\u2019s liability has an overall maximum ceiling, expressed both as a fixed dollar amount, and as percentage of the sales price (which should exclude taxes) of each product. Ideally Zebracorp\u2019s liability for unconsumed products would also expressly exclude the supplier\u2019s margin and would be limited to actual, direct production cost only."

This is largely due to the fact that these type of provisions are likely to cause complications when planning mergers, acquisitions or such other transactions. For example, if Zebracorp was planning on forming a merger with another company, we would work from the assumption that our contracts with our suppliers/subcontractors would be automatically transferred to the new merged entity by operation of law without the need seek consents from our supplier base. An assignment restriction described above is likely to impact the timing, cost and our ability to consummate a \"smooth\" merger or such other transaction. In those critical R&D contracts and the like where we do impose these very same assignment restrictions on our suppliers, it would be better to abandon the entire clause than to agree to mutual clause that would restrict Zebracorp from assigning the contract. The fact that Zebracorp is not willing to make these assignment provisions mutual can often be explained to the supplier by the asymmetric contractual relationship i.e. that of the customer and the supplier.

The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party\u2019s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open. An acquisition or a merger would in most countries serve to \"vest\" all assets and liabilities including contracts automatically to a merging and surviving entity or the acquiring party, as the case may be, by \u2018operation of law\u2019 without a need to obtain a consent from the opposing party.

Where a party wishes to transfer both the benefit and burden of the contract without any residual liability (as is usually the case), the assignment of the contract would generally needs to be done by way of a novation. For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Please speak to a member of the Legal & Compliance team to obtain the appropriate templates/language. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment. This in itself is not issue in the majority of cases, as most jurisdictions will recognize the term novation to mean the same as transfer of a contract.",

Agent 1 also split the two sentences, while others combined them. Evaluation: The text provides specific instructions and desired outcomes for structuring Zebracorp's liability, making it an actionable rule or strong internal directive. The first sentence establishes a mandatory ceiling, and the second, while using 'ideally', sets a clear preferred negotiation position for cost limitation. Therefore, classifying it as a 'GUIDELINE' is most appropriate. The two sentences are intrinsically linked in defining the scope and limits of liability, so combining them into a single finding provides a more complete and coherent record. The finding passes the Value and Utility checks as it is clear, self-sufficient, and provides critical financial protection and negotiation guidance for Zebracorp.",
