Acceptance provisions are essential since they ultimately define whether the works rendered by the subcontractor meet the mutually agreed requirements, and when these works have been completed enabling the supplier/subcontractor to recognize revenue.

Agents 4 and 5 captured the entire clause, with Agent 4 classifying it as a GUIDELINE and Agent 5 as an OTHER (EXAMPLE). \n\nEvaluation: The source text explicitly presents this entire block as 'An example of our preferred assignment clause.' While it is an example, its content directly outlines Zebracorp's preferred contractual terms, which are actionable instructions for negotiators. Therefore, classifying the entire clause as a single, comprehensive GUIDELINE (as in Candidate 4) is the most appropriate approach, as it captures the full strategic intent and actionable language in one coherent record. Breaking it down into smaller parts, while technically correct, loses the holistic 'preferred clause' context provided by the source. The clause is self-sufficient and creates specific rights and obligations. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified given the strategic importance of assignment flexibility and liability mitigation for Zebracorp, as detailed in the preceding text.
