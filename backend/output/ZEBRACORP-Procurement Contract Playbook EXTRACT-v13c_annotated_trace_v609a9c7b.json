The second finding (represented by Candidates 2, 4, 6, 8) details a specific limitation that applies if Zebracorp agrees to take such liability.

The second finding is a subsequent detail within that exception. \n\nConsensus Check: Agents were split on 'Type' for the chosen finding (GUIDELINE vs. OTHER/INSTRUCTION). The text 'This is generally acceptable only in cases where...' sets a specific condition for an action (accepting liability), which is characteristic of a guideline or rule, not just a general instruction. Therefore, 'GUIDELINE' is the correct classification. Agents were also split on 'Classification' (CRITICAL vs. MEDIUM); given the significant financial implications of accepting liability, 'CRITICAL' is appropriate.\n\nValue Assessment: The verbatim text from Candidates 3, 5, 7 was chosen for its completeness, providing full context for the 'This' reference. The plain text is clear and self-sufficient. The finding is actionable and creates a specific restriction on when Zebracorp will consider liability.\n\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific, helps in negotiation by setting clear boundaries, and protects the company from undue financial risk.
