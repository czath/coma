The first, regarding Zebracorp's firm view on assignment by operation of law, had 3 agents classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' (CRITICAL) and 1 as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). The second, regarding a compromise for supplier transfers, had 3 agents classifying it as 'GUIDELINE' (MEDIUM) and 1 as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). \n\nTie-Breaker Decision: For the first finding, 'Zebracorp\u2019s firm view is that... should not require... and in most cases we should reject any language' is a clear, mandatory directive for Zebracorp's negotiation stance, making 'GUIDELINE' the most appropriate type. For the second finding, 'we can make the contract more palatable... by agreeing to allow' describes a specific, conditional action, also fitting 'GUIDELINE'.\n\nValue Assessment: Both findings are clear, self-sufficient, and provide actionable insights. However, the prompt requires a *single* JSON object for the Golden Record. The first finding, Zebracorp's 'firm view' and 'should reject' stance, represents a primary, critical directive, while the second is a secondary, optional compromise. Therefore, the primary, critical directive is selected as the Golden Record for this cluster.\n\nType-Specific Criteria (for selected finding): \n1.  **GUIDELINE**: The text creates a specific obligation/restriction for Zebracorp's negotiation strategy ('should not require', 'should reject').\n2.  **Actionability**: It is highly actionable, dictating Zebracorp's approach to assignment clauses by operation of law.\n3.  **Completeness**: All necessary information is present.\n4.  **Classification**: 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given the explicit 'firm view' and the stated impact on M&A transactions (timing, cost, ability to consummate).\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiation by setting a clear stance, and protects Zebracorp's strategic M&A flexibility. It is a valuable item to keep.",

In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes.

The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company."

For instance, under New York, USA law, 'best efforts' typically only imposes a good faith obligation to attempt to meet an obligation, and failure to achieve it is generally not considered a breach of contract because these phrases are deemed too vague to create a binding, enforceable obligation.",
          "expert_insight": "This highlights critical jurisdictional differences in the enforceability of 'best efforts' clauses. In some legal systems, like NY USA, these clauses are considered too vague to create a binding obligation, offering minimal enforceability and potentially allowing parties to avoid liability for non-achievement, contrasting with common law jurisdictions where they might carry more weight.",

For the general rule, Agents 1, 5, and 7 correctly identified it as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 2 classified it as OTHER/INFO. Agent 4 also classified it as GUIDELINE but included more context. The longer verbatim text (from Candidates 3 and 5) provides a more complete and self-sufficient statement of the rule, including its justification.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The selected GUIDELINE text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides both the core expectation and its underlying rationale. It does not contain dangling references.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The statement 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes a specific obligation and risk allocation for vendors, making it a GUIDELINE. It is not generic advice. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is appropriate given its role as the default position for liability.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This finding is highly specific and actionable, directly informing Zebracorp's default stance on component/materials liability. It is crucial for negotiating supplier agreements and managing financial risk. While the introductory context (OTHER/INFO) was also valuable, the prompt requires a single Golden Record. The GUIDELINE represents the primary, actionable legal finding derived from this cluster, making it the most salient record for a legal analysis system. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is chosen as the Golden Record, and the contextual information is implicitly covered by the 'justification' and 'expert_insight' fields.",
