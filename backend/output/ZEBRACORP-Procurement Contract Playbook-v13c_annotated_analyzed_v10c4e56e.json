The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party\u2019s consent.",

The subsequent sentences in that paragraph ('The risk that the forecast... In cases where the vendor...') provide the justification and tactical advice for this guideline. Given the instruction to return a SINGLE JSON object, the most critical and actionable finding is the 'GUIDELINE'. The introductory 'INFO' paragraph, while valuable context, is not a rule or definition itself and is therefore not selected as the primary Golden Record.

It is complete as stated.

This practice reflects the principle that parties should not be held responsible for disproportionate losses.

This qualifier changes the scope of the indemnity dramatically as it limits the indemnity solely to those damages that a court would order Zebracorp to pay to the third party claimant. Essentially the claim would not only have to be made by the third party claimant but subsequently litigated, and the judgment must be final before the vendor would incur any obligation to compensate us for the damages we have incurred. This leaves a substantial amount of damages and costs out of the indemnity and is only rarely acceptable. This is because most IP lawsuits hardly ever reach a point of final court order but are settled. Zebracorp is also likely to incur costs and damages as a result of in e.g. obtaining replacement products, experiencing production stoppages and order cancellations, customer claims and attorneys fees. If we do exceptionally agree to limit the indemnity to finally awarded damages we should specify that this final award can be either through arbitration or local court and that the supplier will also pay for any sums agreed in a settlement. Also we should insert a provision to specify the supplier\u2019s obligations and liability in the event there is an injunction (i.e. a court order prohibiting ZEBRACORP or its customers from using or distributing the allegedly infringing products/services). Special attention should also be give to the ancillary obligations of the supplier (see section below) to make sure that the supplier has sufficient incentive to seek quick resolution by either providing a non-infringing replacing product and by obtaining a license from the third party claimant). Also we should seek to secure a right to be compensated for our legal fees. It is recommended to consult a member of the Legal & Compliance team in drafting the provision.",

This is generally not acceptable as this type of a limitation would rule out the vendor\u2019s liability for any royalties that our end customer ends up paying to the third party claimant. It would also exclude the vendor\u2019s liability for any royalties that are calculated on a per use basis or calculated in e.g. by the revenues made by the end user. In the event this request to exclude per-use royalties from the scope of the indemnity cannot be negotiated away, it is often preferable to agree to a monetary liability cap instead of agreeing to such request. It is not uncommon for the seller to try to limit its liability for IPR infringement claims to any amounts that would have been due as a reasonable royalty based on the price of the seller\u2019s products. The sellers include this limitation so as to ensure that they end up paying royalties or license fees to a third party based on the value of their product as opposed to value of the Zebracorp product/solution. The difference between the two can be substantial as an example for a component supplier where the value of the infringing component is far lower than the value of in e.g. the Zebracorp system that incorporates the infringing component. Whilst the rationale behind such limitations is understandable, the effect of such limitation can put Zebracorp as substantial disadvantage, and these type of limitations should be carefully considered with IPR and/or Legal & Compliance.",
          "plain_text": "Vendors often attempt to limit IPR infringement liability to reasonable royalties based solely on their revenue derived from Zebracorp or the price of their specific product, rather than the value of Zebracorp's overall solution. This is generally unacceptable as it excludes supplier liability for royalties paid by Zebracorp's end customers or those calculated on a per-use/end-user revenue basis, and can significantly disadvantage Zebracorp, especially when the infringing component's value is far lower than the integrated system. Such limitations require careful consideration with IPR and/or Legal & Compliance. If excluding per-use royalties cannot be negotiated away, agreeing to a monetary liability cap is often a preferable alternative.",
          "expert_insight": "This represents a critical financial risk. Limiting supplier liability to royalties based on their direct revenue from Zebracorp or the price of their component drastically undervalues the actual damages, ignoring downstream liabilities, end-customer royalties, and the overall value of Zebracorp's integrated solution. This can leave Zebracorp with substantial uncompensated losses. Such limitations require strong resistance and mandatory consultation with IPR and/or Legal & Compliance. If a complete rejection isn't feasible, a monetary liability cap is a more predictable and often preferable alternative to flawed royalty calculation bases.",

Knowledge of the existing patent or an intention to infringe the patent is by and large irrelevant.

Instead of agreeing to return the products or cease further use of the products, we should in such cases offer to agree to cease all further distribution and resale of the infringing products. When agreeing to this third option, we should also add language saying that this refund/right to cease further distribution of products is only available to the supplier in the event the two first options (i.e. the Design-Around and Substitution) are not reasonably feasible or achievable, and provided that we are given reasonable time to cease such further distribution. It is also recommended to include the following: \u201c[Supplier] shall at all times act in such a way as to minimise interruption and disruption to the business operations of [ZEBRACORP] and its customers and contractors.\u201d or substantially similar language to protect Zebracorp.",
          "plain_text": "While Design-Around and Substitution options are generally acceptable, suppliers often propose a third option: returning infringing products for a depreciated refund. Zebracorp must be cautious about accepting this, as it can cause irreparable damage and costs if products have been distributed to end customers. Instead of product return, Zebracorp should offer to cease further distribution/resale. If this third option is accepted, it must be contingent on Design-Around and Substitution not being feasible, with reasonable time for Zebracorp to cease distribution. Language should also be added to ensure the supplier minimizes disruption to Zebracorp's and its customers' business operations.",

Further compromise can be made by adding: \u201cZebracorp will affirmatively enforce the sublicensing terms for the software licensed under the sublicense and further agrees that it will assist [Licensor] in the manner reasonably requested by [Licensor] in [Licensor]\u2019s pursuit of an action against any third party for breach of the respective sublicense\u201d.\nIn some instances our licensors will ask that Zebracorp assumes liability for any breach of the sublicense terms and restrictions by its customers. This is not something that we can accept. The customers are independent third parties and Zebracorp cannot control the actions of its customers or give any guarantees of behalf of such parties.

In the event of the occurrence of any such material breach, the [Parties] shall consult in good faith on the next steps with respect to such breach and enforcement of such license restrictions\u201d.\nZebracorp preferred position when it comes to sublicensing terms is to state that we will sublicense to the end customers on same terms that we accept for our own software. Should this not be acceptable to the licensor, we can agree to say in e.g. that: \u201c[Zebracorp] will sublicense the [Licensed Products] to its [End Customers] with license terms that are no less protective of the licensor\u2019s rights than the license terms contained in this [Agreement].\u201d Another equally acceptable compromise position may be found by adding in e.g. the following language: \u201c[ZEBRACORP] may distribute and sublicense the [Licensed Products] to its customers provided that ZEBRACORP does not grant to any such customers any greater rights than [ZEBRACORP] has obtained from the [Licensor]\u201d.",

Alternatively, when licensors request Zebracorp to assume liability for customer breaches, Zebracorp can propose to promptly notify the licensor of any material breach by a customer and consult in good faith on enforcement steps. Regarding sublicensing terms, Zebracorp's preferred position is to sublicense on the same terms it accepts for its own software.

In project specific agreements we should be looking to have LDs at a level corresponding to the LDs required by our end customer so that the LD terms are back-to-back. Higher LD rates should apply in the event the supplier neglects to give us prior warning of the eventual delay. LDs should not be the supplier\u2019s sole liability but we should retain the right to seek direct damages in addition to the LDs, unless the LD\u2019s are high enough that they actually adequately cover the damage that Zebracorp is likely to incur. The right to enforce LDs should not be subject to a grace period since this effectively shifts the agreed lead times forward by the corresponding time period.

It passes the clarity and context checks.\nType-Specific Criteria: The guideline is actionable, complete, and creates a specific obligation for Zebracorp (to obtain express internal approval) and an option (to agree to weekly payments).

All agents classified these as GUIDELINEs with high confidence. Candidate 3 identified the entire example clause as an 'OTHER' type (EXAMPLE subtype). \n\nCONSENSUS CHECK: There is strong consensus among agents regarding the type (GUIDELINE) and high importance (CRITICAL/HIGH) for the specific remedy clauses. The 'OTHER' type for the entire example clause is a singular finding.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The specific remedy clauses are highly actionable and self-sufficient, clearly outlining rights and obligations upon a breach. The 'OTHER' type, while providing context, is less actionable as a standalone finding compared to the specific rules it contains.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: The consolidated GUIDELINE meets all criteria: it is actionable, complete, and correctly classified as CRITICAL due to its direct impact on enforcement and liability. It clearly defines Zebracorp's rights and the Supplier's obligations in case of a breach.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: Consolidating the specific remedy clauses into a single, comprehensive GUIDELINE provides the most valuable and actionable insight for a human negotiator or legal professional. It details the consequences of a breach and the full scope of Zebracorp's recourse. The 'OTHER' type (Candidate 3) is rejected as the primary Golden Record because the specific, actionable rules within the example clause are more critical to extract than the example clause itself as a whole. The consolidated GUIDELINE captures the essence of the most important aspects of the example clause.\n\nDECISION: The two sets of GUIDELINEs (liquidated damages/termination and the 'without prejudice' clause) are highly related and represent a comprehensive statement of remedies for breach. They have been consolidated into a single, robust GUIDELINE. Candidate 3 is implicitly covered by extracting its actionable components and is not chosen as the primary Golden Record.",

Candidates 1, 2, 4, and 6 addressed Zebracorp's strategic stance on Termination for Convenience (TFC) in development projects. Candidates 3, 5, and 7 addressed a specific tactic for implementing Zebracorp's TFC right. Given the instruction to return a single Golden Record, the more fundamental strategic position (Group A: Candidates 1, 2, 4, 6) was prioritized. \n\nCONSENSUS CHECK (Group A): Agents 1 classified parts of the text as 'GUIDELINE', while Agents 2 and 5 classified the full paragraph as 'OTHER' (subtype 'TACTIC' or 'INFO'). The full paragraph provides context and justification for Zebracorp's dual position (needing TFC for itself, but not granting it to suppliers). Therefore, 'OTHER' with 'TACTIC' subtype is the most appropriate classification as it describes a strategic approach and its rationale, rather than a simple rule. The longer verbatim text from Candidates 4 and 6 captures the complete context.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The selected verbatim text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides critical context for Zebracorp's negotiation strategy regarding TFC in development projects. It explains the 'why' behind the policy.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: Classified as 'OTHER' with 'TACTIC' subtype because it outlines a strategic approach and the underlying business reasons, rather than a direct, actionable 'GUIDELINE' or a 'DEFINITION'. It informs how Zebracorp should approach negotiations.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This item is highly specific and provides valuable insight for human negotiators, clarifying Zebracorp's risk management strategy in development agreements. It helps protect the company's interests.\n\nNote: The second group of candidates (3, 5, 7) represents a valid, related tactic for specifying TFC conditions, but was not selected as the primary Golden Record to adhere to the 'single JSON' output requirement.",
