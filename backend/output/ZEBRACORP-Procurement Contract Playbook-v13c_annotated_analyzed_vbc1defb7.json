Their availability and caps vary significantly by jurisdiction, often requiring a higher standard of proof (e.g., clear and convincing evidence).

It represents a higher standard than ordinary negligence, often involving a reckless or conscious and voluntary disregard for the safety or rights of others. Parties frequently seek to exclude liability for gross negligence from general liability caps, meaning that if a party is found grossly negligent, their liability might be unlimited or subject to a higher cap.

Companies should be aware that insurance policies often do not cover punitive damages, making them a significant financial risk in litigation involving gross negligence or intentional misconduct.
