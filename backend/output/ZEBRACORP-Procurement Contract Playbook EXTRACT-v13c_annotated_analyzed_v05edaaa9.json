Acceptance generally triggers the right for the subcontractor to invoice and get paid for its deliverables and it can stop the liquidated damages clock. Moreover, the majority of contracts stipulate that the warranty starts to run from the date of acceptance.",

The verbatim text 'Acceptance provisions should always be drafted and reviewed with special care' is a strong directive for internal contract drafting processes. Given the extensive justification in the source text about the critical impact of these provisions (revenue recognition, payment, liquidated damages, warranty), it functions as a prescriptive rule for Zebracorp's conduct regarding contracts, thus best classified as a GUIDELINE.\nValue Assessment: The statement is clear and self-sufficient. The agents provided excellent context and justification, explaining the 'why' behind this directive by referencing its impact on various contractual aspects.\nType-Specific Criteria (GUIDELINE): It is actionable, directing contract drafters to exercise 'special care'. It is not generic advice, as the source text immediately elaborates on its critical importance. Therefore, a 'CRITICAL' classification is appropriate.\nUtility Check: This is a fundamental and highly important directive for anyone involved in drafting or reviewing contracts, directly impacting risk mitigation and financial outcomes. It is specific enough to be useful.",

For both, classification was split between CRITICAL and HIGH. \n\nType Decision: The phrasing 'would need to be aligned... in order to ensure' and 'it is naturally important that the acceptance is sufficiently aligned' clearly indicates a mandatory obligation or a critical best practice, fitting the 'GUIDELINE' type. The 'OTHER' classification for one candidate was overruled as 'GUIDELINE' is more precise for a contractual obligation. \n\nValue Assessment: Both verbatim texts are clear, self-sufficient, and address a critical risk management principle: 'back-to-back' acceptance alignment. They are highly actionable and provide essential guidance for Zebracorp's contracting practices. \n\nConsolidation Strategy: Given the instruction to return a single JSON object, and the strong thematic overlap, the most detailed and prescriptive verbatim text (from Candidates 1, 3, 4, 6) was chosen as the primary record. The `plain_text`, `expert_insight`, and `source_insight` fields have been crafted to encompass the broader principle and acknowledge the related scenario covered by the second set of candidates, ensuring all valuable information from the cluster is retained. \n\nClassification: 'CRITICAL' was chosen due to the significant financial and contractual exposure Zebracorp faces if these alignment guidelines are not followed.",

Therefore, the Golden Record is consolidated from Candidates 1, 3, 5, and 6, representing this core guideline.

The second (Zebracorp's general rule on vendor responsibility) had a strong majority (3 out of 4 agents) classifying it as 'GUIDELINE', with one agent classifying a longer version of it as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). Tie-Breaker: The phrase 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes an obligation and a core operating principle, making 'GUIDELINE' the appropriate type. Value Assessment & Self-Sufficiency: The 'GUIDELINE' refers to 'such costs'. To make the 'plain_text' self-sufficient, the context defining these costs (from the first verbatim text in the cluster) was incorporated into the 'plain_text' of the 'GUIDELINE'. This ensures clarity and self-sufficiency without creating a separate Golden Record for the contextual information, adhering to the 'single Golden Record' instruction. Type-Specific Criteria: The 'GUIDELINE' creates a clear, actionable obligation for vendors. The classification 'CRITICAL' is appropriate due to the fundamental nature of this rule in allocating significant financial risk. Utility Check: This 'GUIDELINE' is highly specific and crucial for understanding Zebracorp's default position on component/materials liability, directly impacting negotiations and risk management.",
