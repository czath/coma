Combining the two sentences into one GUIDELINE best captures the complete obligation. The language ('company confidential', 'internal use only', 'must not be distributed') is explicit and creates a mandatory requirement for employees. The finding is actionable, self-sufficient, and critical for protecting Zebracorp's strategic interests. Therefore, it is classified as a Critical Guideline.",

In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts.

While the contextual information is accurate, the most actionable and central finding for a 'Golden Record' is Zebracorp's explicit general rule on liability. \n\nCONSENSUS CHECK: For the core rule, Agents 4 and 5 classified it as 'GUIDELINE' (HIGH), while Agent 2 classified it as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). Agents 1 provided fragments of this rule as 'GUIDELINE'. The verbatim text 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes an expectation and obligation, making 'GUIDELINE' the most appropriate type. The 'TACTIC' classification is also valid as it describes Zebracorp's strategic stance, but the underlying nature is a rule of engagement. Therefore, 'GUIDELINE' is chosen as the primary classification.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The chosen guideline is clear, self-sufficient, and highly actionable. It defines Zebracorp's default position on risk allocation for component/material liability, including the rationale (selling party's business risk) and a specific condition (vendor with many customers). It passes the 'So What?' test as it directly impacts contractual negotiations and risk management.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: As a GUIDELINE, it creates a specific obligation/expectation for vendors and defines Zebracorp's stance. It is complete and specific. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified as it's a fundamental principle for managing supply chain risk.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This item is highly specific, helps human negotiators understand Zebracorp's default position, and clarifies a critical aspect of company protection regarding unconsumed materials. It is not filler.",
