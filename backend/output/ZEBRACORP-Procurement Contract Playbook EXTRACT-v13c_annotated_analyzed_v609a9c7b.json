The first finding (represented by Candidates 1, 3, 5, 7) establishes the overarching condition under which Zebracorp may even consider accepting component liability. The second finding (represented by Candidates 2, 4, 6, 8) details a specific limitation that applies if Zebracorp agrees to take such liability. Given the instruction to produce a single Golden Record, the first finding was chosen as it represents the primary gatekeeping rule for Zebracorp's component liability exceptions, making it the more foundational rule. The second finding is a subsequent detail within that exception. \n\nConsensus Check: Agents were split on 'Type' for the chosen finding (GUIDELINE vs. OTHER/INSTRUCTION). The text 'This is generally acceptable only in cases where...' sets a specific condition for an action (accepting liability), which is characteristic of a guideline or rule, not just a general instruction. Therefore, 'GUIDELINE' is the correct classification. Agents were also split on 'Classification' (CRITICAL vs. MEDIUM); given the significant financial implications of accepting liability, 'CRITICAL' is appropriate.\n\nValue Assessment: The verbatim text from Candidates 3, 5, 7 was chosen for its completeness, providing full context for the 'This' reference. The plain text is clear and self-sufficient. The finding is actionable and creates a specific restriction on when Zebracorp will consider liability.\n\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific, helps in negotiation by setting clear boundaries, and protects the company from undue financial risk. It is a critical rule for managing component liability.",
