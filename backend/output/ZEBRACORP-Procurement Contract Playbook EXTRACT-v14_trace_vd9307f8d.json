Such subjective or unilateral criteria can, with the assistance of Zebracorp product line or customer team, be replaced by objective and clearly defined acceptance criteria. In fact, this approach would be preferred over agreeing to language where we merely state that acceptance test will be passed when the deliverables \u2018substantially conform\u2019 or \u201cmaterially comply\u201d with the agreed specifications. Such ambiguous language is often prone to disputes."

While the contextual information is accurate, the most actionable and central finding for a 'Golden Record' is Zebracorp's explicit general rule on liability. \n\nCONSENSUS CHECK: For the core rule, Agents 4 and 5 classified it as 'GUIDELINE' (HIGH), while Agent 2 classified it as 'OTHER' (TACTIC). Agents 1 provided fragments of this rule as 'GUIDELINE'. The verbatim text 'As a general rule, Zebracorp expects its vendors and supplier shoulder such costs...' clearly establishes an expectation and obligation, making 'GUIDELINE' the most appropriate type. The 'TACTIC' classification is also valid as it describes Zebracorp's strategic stance, but the underlying nature is a rule of engagement. Therefore, 'GUIDELINE' is chosen as the primary classification.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT: The chosen guideline is clear, self-sufficient, and highly actionable. It defines Zebracorp's default position on risk allocation for component/material liability, including the rationale (selling party's business risk) and a specific condition (vendor with many customers). It passes the 'So What?' test as it directly impacts contractual negotiations and risk management.\n\nTYPE-SPECIFIC CRITERIA: As a GUIDELINE, it creates a specific obligation/expectation for vendors and defines Zebracorp's stance. It is complete and specific. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified as it's a fundamental principle for managing supply chain risk.\n\nUTILITY CHECK: This item is highly specific, helps human negotiators understand Zebracorp's default position, and clarifies a critical aspect of company protection regarding unconsumed materials. It is not filler.",

The first sentence ('Zebracorp\u2019s liability has an overall maximum ceiling...') establishes a firm requirement for limiting liability. The second sentence ('Ideally Zebracorp\u2019s liability... would also expressly exclude...') provides a strong preference for the scope of that liability, which is a key negotiation point and therefore functions as a guideline for contract terms. It is not merely a 'tactic' but a specific instruction on how Zebracorp's liability *should* be structured.\n\nValue Assessment: The finding is clear, self-sufficient, and highly actionable. It directly addresses Zebracorp's financial exposure.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: As a GUIDELINE, it creates a specific restriction on Zebracorp's liability and provides clear parameters for negotiation and contract drafting. The 'Ideally' clause, while aspirational, is a critical component of Zebracorp's desired contractual position, making the entire statement a 'CRITICAL' guideline for financial protection.\n\nUtility Check: This item is essential for protecting Zebracorp's financial interests by capping liability and defining its scope, making it highly valuable for contract negotiation.",
