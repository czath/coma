          "justification": "Acceptance provisions are essential since they ultimately define whether the works rendered by the subcontractor meet the mutually agreed requirements, and when these works have been completed enabling the supplier/subcontractor to recognize revenue. Acceptance generally triggers the right for the subcontractor to invoice and get paid for its deliverables and it can stop the liquidated damages clock. Moreover, the majority of contracts stipulate that the warranty starts to run from the date of acceptance.",
          "implication_company": "Zebracorp must dedicate sufficient legal and operational resources to carefully craft and scrutinize all acceptance provisions. This ensures protection of its interests regarding payment, warranty, and project completion, mitigates legal and financial risks, and avoids future liabilities, disputes, premature payments, or operational bottlenecks.",
          "implication_supplier": "Suppliers should expect Zebracorp to thoroughly review and potentially negotiate acceptance terms. Clear provisions define when suppliers can invoice, when their warranty period starts, clarify their obligations, and ensure timely revenue recognition and payments, while ambiguous provisions can lead to delays or disputes.",

It is generic advice for contract drafters, albeit critical. Therefore, 'OTHER' with subtype 'INSTRUCTION' is the most appropriate classification.\nValue Assessment: The wording is clear and self-sufficient. The source text immediately provides the justification for this instruction, which is captured in the 'justification' field.\nType-Specific Criteria: As an 'OTHER' (INSTRUCTION), it provides valuable guidance for Zebracorp's internal contract management process. It is not a 'GUIDELINE' because it does not create a specific right, obligation, or restriction for the parties to the contract, but rather advises on the process of creating such provisions.\nUtility Check: This is a highly valuable instruction, emphasizing the critical importance of acceptance provisions due to their wide-ranging impact on payments, warranties, and dispute resolution. It helps a human negotiator understand the foundational importance of these clauses.\nDecision: Valid, classified as OTHER (INSTRUCTION) with HIGH priority.",

The second, identified by Agents 1, 3, and 5, focused on 'best efforts' being 'vague and not providing a firm commitment'. For this second idea, Agents 1 and 5 classified it as a GUIDELINE, while Agent 3 classified it as OTHER. \n\nTie-Breaker & Value Assessment: The source text explicitly states, 'In all cases it is important to keep in mind that the phrase \u2018best efforts\u2019 together with all its variants are ultimately very vague and do not provide a firm commitment to meet the agreed requirement or obligation. Hence, we should, despite their prevalence, be careful in accepting such phrases.' The phrase 'Hence, we should... be careful' clearly indicates a direct instruction or obligation, making it a GUIDELINE. Candidate 5 captures this complete instruction most accurately. The 'source of confusion' (from Agents 2 and 4) is a descriptive characteristic that contributes to the vagueness, but the core actionable advice for the user is the caution against accepting such vague commitments. Therefore, the GUIDELINE is the most critical and actionable finding for this cluster.\n\nType-Specific Criteria: The selected finding is a clear GUIDELINE as it provides specific advice ('be careful in accepting such phrases') that creates an obligation for the company during negotiations. It is not generic advice. The `verbatim_text` is complete and self-sufficient. The classification as 'CRITICAL' is justified because the finding highlights a fundamental risk (lack of firm commitment) that directly impacts enforceability and accountability.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific to 'best efforts' clauses, directly aids in better contract negotiation by warning against a common pitfall, clarifies the inherent weakness of these terms, and protects the company from vague commitments. It passes the utility check.\n\nConsolidation: The Golden Record is built upon Candidate 5, incorporating enhanced expert insights and implications from Candidates 1 and 5 to provide a comprehensive and robust finding. Other candidates were either less complete, misclassified, or represented a less critical, descriptive aspect of the overall issue.",

Evaluation: The source text presents two closely related but distinct aspects of Zebracorp's liability: a mandatory 'overall maximum ceiling' and an 'ideally' preferred scope (excluding supplier's margin, limited to direct cost). Given the instruction to produce a single Golden Record, combining these into a comprehensive 'GUIDELINE' is the most appropriate approach. The first part is a definitive rule, and the second is a strong, specific preference for how that rule should be implemented, both contributing to the overall definition of Zebracorp's liability.
