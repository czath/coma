The acquiring party can either elect to purchase the target company's assets (which enables the acquiring party to pick and choose only the assets and contracts they desire) or alternatively it may elect to acquire the entire company. In an asset sale, the need for contract-by-contract due diligence, would become particularly important since each contract needs to be specifically assigned in the context of asset sale. The acquiring party would generally be able to avoid such issues by electing to acquire the entire share capital of the target company (thereby making it a subsidiary of the acquiring entity) or by merging together with the target company. In the latter case (i.e. when the acquiring party obtains all outstanding shares in the target company and makes the acquired company its subsidiary), there is strictly speaking no need to obtain a consent for the assignment of the related contracts. This is because the contracts in themselves are not \u2018assigned\u2019 to any new legal entity but only the owner of the existing legal entity changes. Contrary to widely held belief, changes in ownership do not generally require the other contracting party\u2019s consent. In companies whose shares are stock-listed the ownership changes each day the market is open. An acquisition or a merger would in most countries serve to \"vest\" all assets and liabilities including contracts automatically to a merging and surviving entity or the acquiring party, as the case may be, by \u2018operation of law\u2019 without a need to obtain a consent from the opposing party.",

Candidates 2, 3, and 4 were fragments of this larger text. There was a split in type classification: Candidate 3 classified a specific sentence as 'GUIDELINE', while others classified the broader text as 'OTHER' (INFO). \n\nDecision on Type: The entire section primarily serves to inform about the legal distinction between assignment and novation under UK law, its implications, and common terminology usage across jurisdictions. While it contains specific recommendations ('it is useful to specifically mention...' and 'Please speak to a member...'), the overarching purpose is informational. Therefore, classifying the consolidated record as 'OTHER' with subtype 'INFO' is most appropriate, with the embedded guidelines highlighted in the plain_text and expert_insight.\n\nValue Assessment: The verbatim text is clear, self-sufficient, and provides critical context regarding UK contract law. The plain_text and expert_insight have been refined to be self-standing and to clearly articulate the actionable advice within the informational context.\n\nType-Specific Criteria (for OTHER/INFO): The information is accurate, necessary (not common knowledge), and well-contextualized. It clarifies a specific legal nuance.\n\nUtility Check: This finding is highly specific, helps in negotiating contracts (especially those under UK law), clarifies confusing legal terms, and protects the company by ensuring proper legal mechanisms are used for contract transfers to avoid residual liability. It is not filler.",

The longer verbatim from Candidate 3 was chosen as the definitive 'verbatim_text' because it fully captures both the rule and its explicit justification, providing complete context.
