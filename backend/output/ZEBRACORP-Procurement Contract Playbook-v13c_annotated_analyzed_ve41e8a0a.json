According to the type-specific criteria, generic advice ('Draft with care') is reclassified as 'OTHER' with subtype 'INSTRUCTION'. \nValue Assessment: The plain text is clear and self-sufficient. The source text immediately provides the crucial context and justification for this instruction, which has been incorporated into the 'justification' field. \nUtility Check: This is a highly useful instruction, emphasizing the critical nature of acceptance provisions for various contractual aspects (payment, warranty, completion, risk mitigation).

All agents agreed on the critical nature of this finding. Evaluation: The finding is actionable, self-sufficient, and creates a specific obligation for Zebracorp to align subcontractor acceptance with customer contracts in specific project scenarios. It directly addresses a critical risk of financial exposure and contractual misalignment. Passed Clarity, Value, Necessity, and Utility checks.

Zebracorp uses these type of contracts with practically all of its component suppliers and the majority of its global OEM vendors.

Without a proper feedback clause it might be possible that the first party to assert that the idea/suggestion forming the feedback is the first party\u2019s proprietary and confidential information and the usage of such feedback would amount to breach of the confidentiality agreement (and potentially also an IPR infringement). Usually the party requesting a right to use feedback will also request a full-blown license to use such feedback. However, Zebracorp should not agree to any broad or open licenses but the license to use feedback must be strictly confined to general comments on the functionality of the products in question, and must not include any Zebracorp intellectual property rights. Under any projects where a party likely gives feedback of the other party\u2019s products or services, in particular in cases where the subcontractor gives us feedback about Zebracorp products or services (other than for which we pay for anyway) we should add the following clause: \u201cThe parties may, but are not obliged to, propose ideas or suggestions to each other relating to the other party\u2019s products and services (\u201cFeedback\u201d). The party receiving Feedback shall be entitled to use and incorporate such Feedback in receiving party\u2019s products/services, at the Feedback receiving party\u2019s sole risk and without any obligation to pay any royalties or other compensation or consideration to the other party for such use/incorporation; provided however that the Feedback is provided \u201cas is\u201d basis without warranties of any kind, and no license, express or implied, is granted by the Feedback giving party to the Feedback receiving party under this clause.\u201d",

This qualifier changes the scope of the indemnity dramatically as it limits the indemnity solely to those damages that a court would order Zebracorp to pay to the third party claimant. Essentially the claim would not only have to be made by the third party claimant but subsequently litigated, and the judgment must be final before the vendor would incur any obligation to compensate us for the damages we have incurred. This leaves a substantial amount of damages and costs out of the indemnity and is only rarely acceptable. This is because most IP lawsuits hardly ever reach a point of final court order but are settled. Zebracorp is also likely to incur costs and damages as a result of in e.g. obtaining replacement products, experiencing production stoppages and order cancellations, customer claims and attorneys fees. If we do exceptionally agree to limit the indemnity to finally awarded damages we should specify that this final award can be either through arbitration or local court and that the supplier will also pay for any sums agreed in a settlement. Also we should insert a provision to specify the supplier\u2019s obligations and liability in the event there is an injunction (i.e. a court order prohibiting ZEBRACORP or its customers from using or distributing the allegedly infringing products/services). Special attention should also be give to the ancillary obligations of the supplier (see section below) to make sure that the supplier has sufficient incentive to seek quick resolution by either providing a non-infringing replacing product and by obtaining a license from the third party claimant). Also we should seek to secure a right to be compensated for our legal fees. It is recommended to consult a member of the Legal & Compliance team in drafting the provision.",

In some of our procurement contract templates, the above options have been defined as obligations of the supplier rather than alternatives that are available to the supplier. There should be no harm in rephrasing the clause so that these obligations are transferred to options, so long as it is clear from the context that choosing one or another of these options does not negate the obligation of the supplier to indemnify Zebracorp for any damages we may have incurred as a result of the IPR claim. The fact remains the supplier will in any case have every incentive to find a solution to the potential IP infringement, and it will do its best to find a design-around or a substitute product even without a contractual obligation to do so.",
          "plain_text": "The supplier's obligation to indemnify Zebracorp for IPR infringement is not relieved by the supplier choosing to implement one of the ancillary options (e.g., Design-Around, Substitution, or Refund/Return). Zebracorp will likely have already incurred damages and costs, and the indemnity must cover these. This is ensured by including language such as 'without prejudice to its indemnity obligation.' Furthermore, while it is acceptable to rephrase these ancillary remedies as 'options' rather than 'obligations' in contract templates, this flexibility must not obscure the supplier's continuing indemnity obligation for incurred damages. Suppliers inherently have an incentive to resolve IP infringement regardless of the specific contractual phrasing of these remedies.",
          "expert_insight": "This is a critical principle: ancillary remedies address future use or cessation of infringement, but Zebracorp will have already incurred costs (legal fees, business disruption, etc.) from the infringement claim itself. The 'without prejudice' clause is vital to ensure the indemnity covers these past damages. While drafting flexibility allows for 'options' instead of 'obligations' for these remedies, this should not be confused with the supplier's distinct and ongoing indemnity liability. Suppliers' commercial drivers often align with resolving infringement, but this doesn't diminish their financial responsibility for damages already caused.",

It is actionable and directly impacts contract negotiation. Utility Check: This is a highly specific and critical rule that directly informs Zebracorp's negotiation strategy and protects its business model. Decision: The comprehensive guideline regarding distribution, sublicensing, and perpetual end-customer licenses (from Candidates 2, 4, 7) is chosen as the Golden Record because it represents the most critical and actionable contractual requirement for Zebracorp's direct procurement strategy, encompassing the core business needs. The other candidates, while related, either cover a subset of this rule or provide informational context rather than a direct contractual obligation.",

Candidates 2, 4, and 7, concerning the helpfulness of spelling out TFC conditions, were split between 'GUIDELINE' and 'OTHER' (TACTIC).
