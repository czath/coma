The `plain_text` and `expert_insight` have been crafted to make this implicit guideline explicit and self-sufficient, passing the Value Assessment. The finding is actionable, creating an obligation for Zebracorp to define acceptance periods to mitigate legal uncertainty and unintended deemed acceptance.

'Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests.' (Candidates 1, 4, 6) - All agents classified this as a GUIDELINE (HIGH).\n2.  'The completion of acceptance should be subject to the successful completion of acceptance tests that are performed by either Zebracorp or our end customers, or, as applicable, both jointly.' (Candidates 2, 3, 5, 7) - Agents were split between GUIDELINE (3 agents) and OTHER (1 agent). \n\nTYPE RESOLUTION: For the second finding, the phrase 'should be subject to' within a section explicitly titled 'Zebracorp Preferred Position' indicates a desired contractual obligation or rule. Therefore, classifying it as a `GUIDELINE` is appropriate, as it defines a specific condition for acceptance that Zebracorp aims to implement in its contracts. The classification of `CRITICAL` is supported by its inclusion in the 'Preferred Position' section and its fundamental nature in controlling the acceptance process.\n\nSELECTION JUSTIFICATION: Given the instruction to produce a *single* Golden Record, and the presence of two distinct rules within the cluster, a choice must be made. The second finding, which states Zebracorp's preferred position on *how* acceptance is determined (i.e., subject to tests performed by Zebracorp or its customers), is a more foundational and strategic guideline. It dictates a core control mechanism for Zebracorp's quality assurance and risk mitigation. The first finding, while important, describes a typical procedural outcome (issuing a certificate) *after* acceptance criteria are met, making it a secondary detail compared to the conditions for acceptance itself. Therefore, the second finding is selected as the primary Golden Record for this cluster due to its strategic importance and explicit mention as a 'Zebracorp Preferred Position'.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT & UTILITY CHECK: The selected finding is clear, self-sufficient, and actionable. It creates a specific condition for acceptance, directly impacting contractual terms and protecting Zebracorp's interests by ensuring control over the verification process. It helps a human negotiate better by highlighting a critical non-negotiable or highly preferred stance.",

The explicit definition of 'An assignment clause' found in the very first sentence of the source text is the most fundamental and direct finding for this cluster. While the contextual information (especially Candidate 3, which was the most comprehensive 'OTHER' finding) is valuable, it serves to explain the *importance* of the clause rather than defining the clause itself.

It accurately describes the function of an assignment clause.\n\nType-Specific Criteria (Definition): It accurately defines a specific legal term ('assignment clause') central to the document, not a common English word. It passes the necessity test as it clarifies a key concept.\n\nUtility Check: This definition is highly useful as it clarifies a core concept, which is essential for understanding the subsequent guidelines and discussions in the text.

Where a party wishes to transfer both the benefit and burden of the contract without any residual liability (as is usually the case), the assignment of the contract would generally needs to be done by way of a novation. For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment.

Therefore, 'GUIDELINE' is the correct classification.\n\nValue Assessment: The text is clear, self-sufficient, and actionable. It defines a critical requirement for suppliers when Zebracorp accepts component liability, preventing indefinite exposure to claims.\n\nType-Specific Criteria (GUIDELINE): The finding creates a specific obligation for the supplier regarding claim submission and a clear restriction (forfeiture of rights) if not met. It is highly actionable and specific, not generic advice. Its impact on Zebracorp's financial exposure makes it 'CRITICAL'.\n\nUtility Check: This item is highly specific and crucial for managing Zebracorp's financial risk by setting a time limit for claims.
