All agents classifying it as a GUIDELINE also assigned a 'CRITICAL' classification, which is appropriate given the significant financial and contractual risks involved in misaligned acceptance. The verbatim text represents a clear, actionable obligation for Zebracorp to align subcontractor acceptance provisions with customer contracts to prevent premature acceptance. This guideline is more specific and comprehensive than the general statement about 'sufficient alignment' found in other candidates (Group 3, e.g., Candidate 3, 8, 11), which is considered redundant as its intent is fully captured here. The guideline regarding 'commercial evaluation periods' (Group 2, e.g., Candidate 2, 5, 7, 10) is distinct but more specific. Given the instruction to return a SINGLE JSON object, the general acceptance alignment is chosen as the overarching and most critical guideline from this cluster, encompassing the broader principle of back-to-back acceptance.",

        "rationale": "CONSENSUS CHECK: The cluster contains two distinct findings based on different verbatim texts. \n1.  'Once the results of services/deliverables pass the acceptance tests and otherwise fulfil the required acceptance criteria, Zebracorp would typically be required to issue a written acceptance certificate evidencing the completion of acceptance tests.' (Candidates 1, 4, 6) - All agents classified this as a GUIDELINE (HIGH).\n2.  'The completion of acceptance should be subject to the successful completion of acceptance tests that are performed by either Zebracorp or our end customers, or, as applicable, both jointly.' (Candidates 2, 3, 5, 7) - Agents were split between GUIDELINE (3 agents) and OTHER (1 agent). \n\nTYPE RESOLUTION: For the second finding, the phrase 'should be subject to' within a section explicitly titled 'Zebracorp Preferred Position' indicates a desired contractual obligation or rule. Therefore, classifying it as a `GUIDELINE` is appropriate, as it defines a specific condition for acceptance that Zebracorp aims to implement in its contracts. The classification of `CRITICAL` is supported by its inclusion in the 'Preferred Position' section and its fundamental nature in controlling the acceptance process.\n\nSELECTION JUSTIFICATION: Given the instruction to produce a *single* Golden Record, and the presence of two distinct rules within the cluster, a choice must be made. The second finding, which states Zebracorp's preferred position on *how* acceptance is determined (i.e., subject to tests performed by Zebracorp or its customers), is a more foundational and strategic guideline. It dictates a core control mechanism for Zebracorp's quality assurance and risk mitigation. The first finding, while important, describes a typical procedural outcome (issuing a certificate) *after* acceptance criteria are met, making it a secondary detail compared to the conditions for acceptance itself. Therefore, the second finding is selected as the primary Golden Record for this cluster due to its strategic importance and explicit mention as a 'Zebracorp Preferred Position'.\n\nVALUE ASSESSMENT & UTILITY CHECK: The selected finding is clear, self-sufficient, and actionable. It creates a specific condition for acceptance, directly impacting contractual terms and protecting Zebracorp's interests by ensuring control over the verification process. It helps a human negotiate better by highlighting a critical non-negotiable or highly preferred stance.",

For this reason, when the agreement is governed by UK laws, it is useful to specifically mention that the agreement is not only assigned but also novated, and the transfer of the rights and obligations may require the execution of a specific novation agreement. Due to the prevalence of UK origin contract documentation, the term novation and novation agreements in general are often (incorrectly) used in other jurisdictions as well when the parties should be talking about contract transfer or assignment.

It addresses a common point of confusion. Utility Check: This finding is highly useful as it prevents unnecessary administrative burdens (seeking consent for mere name changes) and clarifies the scope of assignment clauses.

Decision: Classified as GUIDELINE because it establishes a specific, actionable condition under which Zebracorp may accept liability, rather than merely a general tactic. Value Assessment: The verbatim text from Candidates 2 and 3 provides the necessary context for the pronoun 'This', making the finding self-sufficient and clear. The plain text accurately summarizes this condition. Type-Specific Criteria: It creates a specific restriction on Zebracorp's willingness to accept liability. Utility Check: This finding is critical as it defines a strict boundary for Zebracorp's financial exposure, aiding in negotiation and risk management. Classification: CRITICAL due to its gatekeeping nature for liability acceptance.",
