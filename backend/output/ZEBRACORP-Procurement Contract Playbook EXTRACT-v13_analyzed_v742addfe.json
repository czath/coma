Evaluation: The source text 'ACCEPTANCE' is a single word, likely a heading or a term, and does not provide any accompanying definition or specific rule. Candidate 1 provides a general legal definition of 'acceptance' which, while accurate as a legal concept, is not present in the provided source text. This constitutes external knowledge rather than an extraction from the source, failing the 'Accuracy based on the text' and 'Self-Sufficient' criteria for definitions. Candidate 2 merely states that the term is presented, which is trivial and adds no value. The system's purpose is to extract specific, self-sufficient information directly from the source text, not to infer general knowledge based on headings or provide trivial observations. Therefore, this cluster is rejected as it fails the core principle of extracting valid, self-contained information directly from the source.",
