      "text": "25.\tFINAL PROVISIONS\n25.1\tEntire Agreement\nThis Agreement (including its Appendices) state the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior communications, whether written or oral, between the Parties. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts by either handwritten signatures or e-signatures. By using e-signature to sign this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge that execution in this manner creates a binding contract between the Parties. All amendments and modifications to this Agreement shall be made by an instrument in writing signed by both Parties. However, the Parties acknowledge that some of the Appendices of this Agreement further include appendices that are intended to be revised periodically by Zebracorp (such as but not limited to Zebracorp specs) and to the extent that such revisions do not conflict with the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the respective Appendix, updated versions of such appendices may be issued by Zebracorp without requiring a formal amendment either to this Agreement or to the respective Appendix. The Parties agree that in such cases Zebracorp notifies the Supplier upon the new appendix (in written or electronic format) and such appendix shall be deemed accepted by the Supplier unless the Supplier notifies Zebracorp of the rejection of such new appendix within thirty (30) days of the receipt of Zebracorp\u2019s notice.\nThe Agreement and the Appendices form one integral agreement.\nIn the event of any conflict between any terms and conditions of this Agreement and its Appendices, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail over those of any Appendix hereto unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Appendix whereby the respective Appendix shall prevail with respect to the subject matter stipulated therein.\n25.2\tAssignment and Transfer\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither Party may assign, novate, delegate, or transfer this Agreement, or any of its individual rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written approval of the other Party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any attempted assignment, novation, delegation, or transfer without the necessary approval is void. However, Zebracorp may, without the prior written consent of Supplier, unconditionally assign, novate, delegate or transfer any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole, in part, or through a splitting of the Agreement, to any Affiliate or to any acquirer of a Zebracorp business line to which this contract relates. As of the effective date of the assignment, novation, delegation, or transfer, the assignee entity(ies) assumes all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the Agreement, and Zebracorp is unconditionally released and discharged from all of the relevant rights, obligations and liabilities of the Agreement. Supplier will work cooperatively with Zebracorp and the assignee entity(ies) to ensure a smooth and orderly transition.\n25.3\tNotices\nAny notice given by one Party to the other shall be deemed properly given if specifically acknowledged by the receiving Party in writing or when delivered to the recipient by mail, fax or courier to the following addresses (or such other address as may be notified in writing from time to time by either Party):\nif to Zebracorp, to\nlegal@zebracorp.com\ncc. Zebracorp\nif to the Supplier, to\nhannibal@aprecot.com\nNotices shall be deemed to be received on the first business day following receipt. Each communication and document made or delivered by one Party to another pursuant to this Agreement shall be in the English language or accompanied by a translation thereof.\n25.4\tNo Waiver\nNo failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of either Party, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. For the avoidance of doubt, it is further expressly stated any payment made by Zebracorp shall be without prejudice to any rights of Zebracorp.\n25.5\tPartial Invalidity\nIf, at any time, any provision hereof is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction shall in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The invalid provision shall be replaced by a valid provision, which achieves to the extent possible the original purpose and commercial goal of the invalid provision.\n25.6\tGoverning Law\nThis Agreement shall be governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of New York, USA excluding its choice of law provisions. The Parties specifically disclaim the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\n25.7\tDispute Resolution\nAny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination or validity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the US Chamber of Commerce. The seat of arbitration shall be New York, USA. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The proceedings shall be confidential. The award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nEach Party shall be entitled to seek necessary and appropriate interim measures of protection from any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the other Party from taking actions which may adversely affect the rights of the Party bringing such claim, provided that any proceedings and decisions as to the merits of the dispute are exclusively governed and resolved by arbitration in accordance with this arbitration Clause.\n25.8\tSurviving Clauses\nAny terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive a cancellation, termination or expiry of this Agreement shall also be deemed to survive. Such terms and conditions include but are not limited to Clauses: 4 (Grant of Licenses and other rights), 10 (Warranty), 12 (Intellectual Property Rights), 17 (Confidentiality), 19 (Effect of Termination), 22 (Limitation of Liability), 25 (Arbitration and Applicable Law). The Maintenance and Support Agreement Appendix shall at all times survive the termination or expiration or expiry of this Agreement.\n25.9\tIndependent Parties\nThe Parties shall be independent contractors hereunder and this Agreement shall not create or form any partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, representative or employment relationship between the Parties nor between Zebracorp and any Affiliate, Supplier, subcontractor or employee of the Supplier. Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties, neither Party shall make any express or implied agreements, warranties, guarantees, commitments or representations, or incur any debt, in the name or on behalf of the other Party.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been signed by the duly authorized representatives of both Parties.\ncompany:\tZebracorp\nBy:\t{{*Sig_es_:signer1:signature}}\nName:\t{{*N_es_:signer1:fullname}}\nTitle:\t{{Ttl_es_: signer1:title                                             }}\nDate:\t{{*Dte_es_:signer1:date}}\nCompany:\tZebracorp\nBy:\t{{*Sig_es_:signer2:signature}}\nName:\t{{*N_es_:signer2:fullname}}\nTitle:\t{{Ttl_es_: signer2:title                                             }}\nDate:\t{{*Dte_es_:signer2:date}}\nCompany:\tSUPPLIER\nBy:\t{{*Sig_es_:signer3:signature}}\nName:\t{{*N_es_:signer3:fullname}}\nTitle:\t{{Ttl_es_: signer3:title                                             }}\nDate:\t{{*Dte_es_:signer3:date}}\ncompany:\tSUPPLIER\nBy:\t{{*Sig_es_:signer4:signature}}\nName:\t{{*N_es_:signer4:fullname}}\nTitle:\t{{Ttl_es_: signer4:title                                             }}\nDate:\t{{*Dte_es_:signer4:date}}\n{{transstamp2_es_:transactionid}}"
