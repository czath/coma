background:
ou are an expert Legal Contract Manager. 
In your current assignment you are analyzing a procurement contract playbook (that is a document containing the corporate recommended guidelines that the company applies every time it is negotiating commercial agreements with vendors), and extract from it in a precise and properly structured way the key thematic topics ("taxonomy") and the rules that are defined ("rules").
The playbook was long and was divided into several thematic sections. You have already processed all sections one by one and extracted the topics and rules separately per section. But you see that there is potential duplication in the extracted topics, and now you need to remove the duplicates and prepare a clean canonical list of topics.

your task:
Create a clean, Canonical List of topics (subjects) by consolidating.

### INPUT:
JSON Groups of similar topics with their definitions.
Example:
{
  "Group A": {
      "Topic A": "Definition...",
      "Topic B": "Definition..."
  }
}

### GOAL:
Review the items of the group.
Determine which items, even though they may be expressed differently, are refering to the same  (**FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT**) concept and consolidate them by keeping the best one and removing the rest.
If they refer to distinct concepts, you can proceed to keep all that you consider necessary.

### JUDGMENT RULES:
1. **Taxonomy (Categorization Tags)**:
   - These **SHOULD NOT** be dictionary definitions. These SHOULD be broad **functional tags** that will be used to group rules thematically in topics (e.g., "PAYMENT", "LIABILITY", "DATA_PRIVACY").
   - The `description` field SHOULD broadly and briefly describe the **category** (e.g. "Rules related to payment processing").
   - You MUST generalize the tags to the extent that is semantically possible, and avoid the creation of overly specific tags. You MUST use standard commonly used commercial law verbiage, nomenclature, naming and categories as much as possible and avoid adopting company specific language from the text. You must use full form in the display_name and if there are commonly used acronyms add them in parentheses (e.g. "Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)").

2.  **GRAMMATICAL VARIATIONS (Topic Selection)**:
    *   replace topics when the topic differs only grammatically or syntactically, i.e., Pluralization, Articles ("The"), Capitalization, or Ordering of words (e.g. if you have "Warranty" and "Warranties" keep the first and remove the second)
    *   replace a topic where the topic is just expressed as an abreviation of the full form or acronym (example: if you have "Scope of Work" and "SoW" keep the first and remove the second)
    *   **Action**: Always preserve the one that is more clear, more commonly used in commercial contracts, is in standard/singular form and is more comprehensive and replace the others.

3.  **SUBSTANTIVE IDENTITY (Contextual Selection)**:
    *   **consider duplicates even if topic is different when:**:
        *   The definitions explicitly state the topics are synonymous/interchangeable.
        *   The definitions cover the same (**FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT**) legal scope and subject matter, even if wording differs.
    *   **KEEP SEPARATE IF**:
        *   One topic is a discrete SUBSET of the other (e.g. "Background IPR" is a specific type of "IPR").
        *   One topic is used in different context (e.g. "Contractual Term" refers to a legal term while "Contract Term" refers to the duration of the contract)
        *   The topics represent distinct legal triggers or categories that are better be kept distinct.

### OUTPUT:
Return a JSON Object mapping EVERY input topic to its Canonical Name (the selected topic). Properly formulate (capilalize first letter of each word or keep all cap when is acronym)

Example Output:
{
  "Product Warranties": "Product Warranty",
  "Product Warranty": "Product Warranty",
  "IPR": "Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)",
  "Background IPR": "Background IPR"
}
