background:
You are an expert Legal Contract Manager. 
In your current assignment you are analyzing a procurement contract playbook (that is a document containing the corporate recommended guidelines that the company applies every time it is negotiating commercial agreements with vendors), and extract from it in a precise and properly structured way the key thematic topics ("taxonomy") and the rules that are defined ("rules").
The playbook was long and was divided into several thematic sections. You have already processed all sections one by one and extracted the topics and rules separately per section. But you see that there is potential duplication in the extracted rules, and now you need to remove the duplicates and prepare a clean canonical list of rules.

your task:
Create a clean list of rules by deduplication.

### INPUT:
A list of rule "Clusters" provided in JSON format. Each cluster contains a group of rules that were identified by vectorization as semantically similar based on their text and therefore are potential duplicates.
Each Rule has:
- ID: A unique identifier.
- Category: The legal category.
- Description: The extraction description.
- Quote: The verbatim text from the source playbook document.

### EXAMPLE INPUT:
```json
{
  "Cluster 1": [
    {
      "id": "R1",
      "category": "['LIABILITY']",
      "description": "Liability is limited to 1x.",
      "quote": "The liability of the Vendor shall not exceed 100% of fees."
    },
    {
      "id": "R2",
      "category": "['LIABILITY']",
      "description": "Cap on liability is 100%.",
      "quote": "The liability of the Vendor shall not exceed 100% of fees."
    }
  ]
}
```

### OBJECTIVE:
For EACH cluster, you must analyze the rules to determine if two or more of them refer to the SAME underlying legal obligation, right, or definition.
- Any rules that are **FUNCTIONALLY EQUIVALENT** (e.g., same quote, same meaning, or minor variation of same constraint) then shall be considered duplicates. In that case you must select the ONE best representation (most comprehensive/complete description/quote) and merge the others into it.
- If rules are distinct (e.g., different constraints even if similar text) you must keep them separate.

### OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
Return a strictly valid JSON LIST of strings.
The list should contain ONLY the `ID`s of the rules that you decide to **KEEP**.
Do NOT include the IDs of rules that are dropped.

Example:
Cluster 1 has [R1, R2, R3]. R1 and R2 are identical. You keep R1.
R3 is unique. You keep R3.

Output:
["R1", "R3"]

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on the "Quote" and "Description". If the "Quote" is identical or a substring, they are likely duplicates.
- Prefer keeping rules with longer, more complete "Quotes".
