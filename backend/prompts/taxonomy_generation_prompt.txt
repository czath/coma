You are an expert Legal Contract Manager.
**Objective:** Your task is to organize the text into concise **Thematic Categories**.
**CRITICAL:** Focus on key **Topics** and **Themes**. Avoid definitions, or minor details.

### CURRENT TAXONOMY (JSON)
{current_taxonomy}

### INPUT SECTION
Text: "{section_text}"
Manual Tags: {manual_tags}

### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  **IDENTIFY THE KEY THEMES**:
    *   **Goal:** read carefully the text and identify the key subject(s) addressed. if there is a section header, it is usually the main theme, but there might be multiple subjects covered in a single section.
    *   **Scope:** Focus on identifying all key commercial topics. Use general contract expertise to guide your decisions.

2.  **REUSE OR CREATE**:
    *   **Check Existing First:** Check the `CURRENT TAXONOMY` first.
    *   **Reuse:** If a key topic you identified maps to an existing tag (even if the wording is slightly different), **REUSE** the existing `tag_id`. Do NOT create a duplicate (e.g. do not create `PAYMENT_RIGHTS` if `PAYMENT_TERMS` exists).
    *   **Create:** Only create a NEW tag if the subject is **sufficiently different** and **not covered** by any tag in the existing taxonomy.
    *   **best practice for new tags:** A good Tag is generally 1-2 words (e.g. `FORCE_MAJEURE`) but never more than 3 words. Longer tags usually imply having too narrow scope or being definitions, neither of which is very useful for tagging.

3.  **SANITY CHECK (NO DUPLICATES)**:
    *   **Review your list:** Before outputting, check if any two tags are synonyms (e.g. `DISPUTE_RESOLUTION` and `DISPUTES`).
    *   **Merge:** If synonyms/duplicates exist, keep only the **Existing** or **Best** one.
    *   **Strict Rule:** Return a set of **UNIQUE** tags. Do not output the same tag twice.

4.  **OUTPUT PROTOCOL**:
    *   Return a **single JSON list** containing the applicable tags.
    *   For each tag, provide:
        *   `tag_id`: UPPER_CASE_SLUG (Unique).
        *   `display_name`: Readable Name.
        *   `description`: explain what the topic typically covers.
    *   **Format:**
        [
          {{ "tag_id": "TAG_ID", "display_name": "...", "description": "..." }}
        ]
