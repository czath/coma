In the event that a withholding tax is payable, Zebracorp shall be entitled to deduct the withholding tax from the payment to the Supplier as required under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties. Upon request of the Supplier, Zebracorp agrees to furnish evidence of such paid taxes to the Supplier as is sufficient to enable the Supplier to obtain any tax credits available to it.\n9.7\tIf an Order under this Agreement is made by a US based Affiliate of Zebracorp, then notwithstanding the tax obligations as defined in Clause 9.6 above, for sales to US based Affiliate of Zebracorp, Supplier shall provide Zebracorp with a completed tax certification (e.g. Form W-9, applicable Form W-8 series form, or Form 8233, as appropriate) for federal income tax reporting purposes.

Failure to meet these requirements could result in a delay in payment.  Zebracorp shall have no liability to Supplier for late payments that result from Supplier\u2019s failure to comply with this Clause.
