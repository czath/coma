      "verification_quote": "Usually the triggers include: A certain percentage of defects found during a particular time frame. As an example, we can agree that Epidemic Failure shall be deemed to take place in the event of a failure occurring in [XX] percent or more of total number of products purchased within [YY] number of months or days. The numbers can be adjusted depending on the nature of the products. Obviously the higher the percentage threshold, the less likely the Epidemic Failure clause can be used. It is often recommended to have more than one trigger. As an example we could agree, that a failure rate equal or above [XX] % during any given one-month period or a failure rate equal or above [XX] % during any given six-month period, will trigger an Epidemic Failure.",

      "type": "DEFINITION",
      "severity": "LOW",
      "verification_quote": "Sophisticated vendors will prefer to insert a requirement that certain minimum number of units must found to be defective in order to trigger Epidemic Failure. This is mostly acceptable. For example, if the trigger is 1%, but only 200 units were sold, then two defective units whose defect is attributable to the same root cause would constitute an Epidemic Failure because 1% of 200 is two. These anomalies can be eliminated by adding a provision that requires there to be a minimum number (e.g., a minimum of 10 defective units) in order to trigger the Epidemic Failure clause.",
