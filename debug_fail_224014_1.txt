        "implication_supplier": "Supplier cannot prevent the automatic transfer of the contract to a new entity resulting from Company's corporate restructuring, potentially leading to a new contracting party without their explicit consent, unless specific restrictions are mutually agreed upon (which Company generally rejects). If such a clause is included, it would be ineffective for Company's assignment by operation of law without Company's prior written consent, as per the example clause provided in the text for rejection by Company. However, the Company's firm view is to reject such clauses entirely for itself. If the supplier insists on such a clause, the Company would reject it for itself, but may accept it for the supplier if the assignee is not a competitor, as per a later guideline. The example clause provided in the text is an example of what the Company would reject for itself: 'Any attempted assignment of this [Agreement] whether directly, by change in control or by operation of law, shall be ineffective unless effected with the other party’s prior written consent'. The Company's position is to reject such a clause for itself, but may accept it for the supplier under certain conditions (not a competitor). The implication for the supplier is that they will likely not be able to impose such a restriction on the Company's assignment by operation of law. If the supplier has such a clause in their template, the Company will reject it for itself. If the supplier is subject to such a clause, it means their assignment by operation of law would require Company's consent, unless the Company agrees to a non-competitor exception for the supplier.
